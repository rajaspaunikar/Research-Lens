Title   : FMANet: A Novel Dual-Phase Optical Flow Approach with Fusion Motion Attention Network for Robust Micro-expression Recognition
Source  : Submitted 15 October, 2025; v1 submitted 9 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: Facial micro-expressions, characterized by their subtle and brief nature, are valuable indicators of genuine emotions. Despite their significance in psychology,security, and behavioral analysis, micro-expression recognition remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing subtle facial movements. Optical flow has been widely employed as an input modality for this task due to its effectiveness. However, most existing methods compute optical flow only between the onset and apex frames, thereby overlooking essential motion information in the apex-to-offset phase. To address this limitation, we first introduce a comprehensive motion representation, termed Magnitude-Modulated Combined Optical Flow (MM-COF), which integrates motion dynamics from both micro-expression phases into a unified descriptor suitable for direct use in recognition networks. Building upon this principle, we then propose FMANet, a novel end-to-end neural networkarchitecturethat internalizes the dual-phase analysis and magnitude modulation into learnable modules. This allows the network to adaptively fuse motion cues and focus on salient facial regions for classification. Experimental evaluations on the MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, and SAMM datasets, widely recognized as standard benchmarks, demonstrate that our proposed MM-COF representation and FMANet outperforms existing methods, underscoring the potential of a learnable, dual-phase framework in advancing micro-expression recognition.△ Less

Title   : Who Speaks for the Trigger? Dynamic Expert Routing in Backdoored Mixture-of-Experts Transformers
Source  : Submitted 15 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)architecturesachieve impressive performance and efficiency by dynamically routing inputs to specialized subnetworks, known as experts. However, this sparse routing mechanism inherently exhibits task preferences due to expert specialization, introducing a new and underexplored vulnerability to backdoor attacks. In this work, we investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of injecting backdoors into MoE-based LLMs by exploiting their inherent expert routing preferences. We thus propose BadSwitch, a novel backdoor framework that integrates task-coupled dynamic trigger optimization with a sensitivity-guided Top-S expert tracing mechanism. Our approach jointly optimizes trigger embeddings during pretraining while identifying S most sensitive experts, subsequently constraining the Top-K gating mechanism to these targeted experts. Unlike traditional backdoor attacks that rely on superficial data poisoning or model editing, BadSwitch primarily embeds malicious triggers into expert routing paths with strong task affinity, enabling precise and stealthy model manipulation. Through comprehensive evaluations across three prominent MoEarchitectures(Switch Transformer, QwenMoE, and DeepSeekMoE), we demonstrate that BadSwitch can efficiently hijack pre-trained models with up to 100% success rate (ASR) while maintaining the highest clean accuracy (ACC) among all baselines. Furthermore, BadSwitch exhibits strong resilience against both text-level and model-level defense mechanisms, achieving 94.07% ASR and 87.18% ACC on the AGNews dataset. Our analysis of expert activation patterns reveals fundamental insights into MoE vulnerabilities. We anticipate this work will exposesecurityrisks in MoE systems and contribute to advancing AI safety.△ Less

Title   : Towards Trusted Service Monitoring: Verifiable Service Level Agreements
Source  : Submitted 15 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: Service Level Agreement (SLA) monitoring in service-oriented environments suffers from inherent trust conflicts when providers self-report metrics, creating incentives to underreport violations. We introduce a framework for generating verifiable SLA violation claims through trusted hardware monitors and zero-knowledge proofs, establishing cryptographic foundations for genuine trustworthiness in service ecosystems. Our approach starts with machine-readable SLA clauses converted into verifiable predicates and monitored within Trusted Execution Environments. These monitors collect timestamped telemetry, organize measurements into Merkle trees, and produce signed attestations. Zero-knowledge proofs aggregate Service-Level Indicators to evaluate compliance, generating cryptographic proofs verifiable by stakeholders, arbitrators, or insurers in disputes, without accessing underlying data. This ensures threesecurityproperties: integrity, authenticity, and validity. Our prototype demonstrates linear scaling up to over 1 million events per hour for measurements with near constant-time proof generation and verification for single violation claims, enabling trustless SLA enforcement through cryptographic guarantees for automated compliance verification in service monitoring.△ Less

Title   : Evaluating Relayed and Switched Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) NetworkArchitectures
Source  : Submitted 15 October, 2025; v1 submitted 29 September, 2025; originally announced September 2025.
Abstract: We evaluate the performance of twoarchitecturesfor network-wide quantum key distribution (QKD): Relayed QKD, which relays keys over multi-link QKD paths for non-adjacent nodes, and Switched QKD, which uses optical switches to dynamically connect arbitrary QKD modules to form direct QKD links between them. An advantage of Switched QKD is that it distributes quantum keys end-to-end, whereas Relayed relies on trusted nodes. However, Switched depends on arbitrary matching of QKD modules. We first experimentally evaluate the performance of commercial DV-QKD modules; for each of three vendors we benchmark the performance in standard/matched module pairs and in unmatched pairs to emulate configurations in the Switched QKD networkarchitecture. The analysis reveals that in some cases a notable variation in the generated secret key rate (SKR) between the matched and unmatched pairs is observed. Driven by these experimental findings, we conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis that evaluates the network-wide performance of the twoarchitectures. Our analysis is based on uniform ring networks, where we derive optimal key management configurations and analytical formulas for the achievable consumed SKR. We compare network performance under varying ring sizes, QKD link losses, QKD receivers' sensitivity and performance penalties of unmatched modules. Our findings indicate that Switched QKD performs better in dense rings (short distances, large node counts), while Relayed QKD is more effective in longer distances and large node counts. Moreover, we confirm that unmatched QKD modules penalties significantly impact the efficiency of Switched QKDarchitecture.△ Less

Title   : SafeGuider: Robust and Practical Content Safety Control for Text-to-Image Models
Source  : Submitted 15 October, 2025; v1 submitted 5 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: Text-to-image models have shown remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality images from natural language descriptions. However, these models are highly vulnerable to adversarial prompts, which can bypass safety measures and produce harmful content. Despite various defensive strategies, achieving robustness against attacks while maintaining practical utility in real-world applications remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we first conduct an empirical study of the text encoder in the Stable Diffusion (SD) model, which is a widely used and representative text-to-image model. Our findings reveal that the [EOS] token acts as a semantic aggregator, exhibiting distinct distributional patterns between benign and adversarial prompts in its embedding space. Building on this insight, we introduce SafeGuider, a two-step framework designed for robust safety control without compromising generation quality. SafeGuider combines an embedding-level recognition model with a safety-aware feature erasure beam search algorithm. This integration enables the framework to maintain high-quality image generation for benign prompts while ensuring robust defense against both in-domain and out-of-domain attacks. SafeGuider demonstrates exceptional effectiveness in minimizing attack success rates, achieving a maximum rate of only 5.48\% across various attack scenarios. Moreover, instead of refusing to generate or producing black images for unsafe prompts, SafeGuider generates safe and meaningful images, enhancing its practical utility. In addition, SafeGuider is not limited to the SD model and can be effectively applied to other text-to-image models, such as the Flux model, demonstrating its versatility and adaptability across differentarchitectures. We hope that SafeGuider can shed some light on the practical deployment ofsecuretext-to-image systems.△ Less

Title   : Real-Time Crowd Counting for Embedded Systems with LightweightArchitecture
Source  : Submitted 15 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: Crowd counting is a task of estimating the number of the crowd through images, which is extremely valuable in the fields of intelligentsecurity, urban planning, public safety management, and so on. However, the existing counting methods have some problems in practical application on embedded systems for these fields, such as excessive model parameters, abundant complex calculations, etc. The practical application of embedded systems requires the model to be real-time, which means that the model is fast enough. Considering the aforementioned problems, we design a super real-time model with a stem-encoder-decoder structure for crowd counting tasks, which achieves the fastest inference compared with state-of-the-arts. Firstly, large convolution kernels in the stem network are used to enlarge the receptive field, which effectively extracts detailed head information. Then, in the encoder part, we use conditional channel weighting and multi-branch local fusion block to merge multi-scale features with low computational consumption. This part is crucial to the super real-time performance of the model. Finally, the feature pyramid networks are added to the top of the encoder to alleviate its incomplete fusion problems. Experiments on three benchmarks show that our network is suitable for super real-time crowd counting on embedded systems, ensuring competitive accuracy. At the same time, the proposed network reasoning speed is the fastest. Specifically, the proposed network achieves 381.7 FPS on NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti and 71.9 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson TX1.△ Less

Title   : Visible Yet Unreadable: A Systematic Blind Spot of Vision Language Models Across Writing Systems
Source  : Submitted 15 October, 2025; v1 submitted 4 September, 2025; originally announced September 2025.
Abstract: Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing, recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations, frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivatearchitecturesand training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, andsecurity.△ Less

Abstract: Indoor robotic systems within Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are increasingly exposed to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks that compromise localization, control and telemetry integrity. We propose a privacy-aware malware detection framework for indoor robotic systems, which leverages hybrid quantum computing and deep neural networks to counter DoS threats in CPS, while preserving privacy information.

The system operates without handcrafted thresholds or persistent beacon data, enabling scalable deployment in adversarial environments. Benchmarking reveals robust generalization, interpretability and resilience against training instability through modular circuit design.

Title   : SemVink: Advancing VLMs' Semantic Understanding of Optical Illusions via Visual Global Thinking
Source  : Submitted 14 October, 2025; v1 submitted 3 June, 2025; originally announced June 2025.
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in semantic tasks but falter at a core human capability: detecting hidden content in optical illusions or AI-generated images through perceptual adjustments like zooming. We introduce HC-Bench, a benchmark of 112 images with hidden text, objects, and illusions, revealing that leading VLMs achieve near-zero accuracy (0-5.36%)-even with explicit prompting. Humans resolve such ambiguities instinctively, yet VLMs fail due to an overreliance on high-level semantics. Strikingly, we propose SemVink (Semantic Visual Thinking) by simply scaling images to low resolutions (32-128 pixels), which unlocks >99% accuracy by eliminating redundant visual noise. This exposes a criticalarchitecturalflaw: VLMs prioritize abstract reasoning over low-level visual operations crucial for real-world robustness. Our work urges a shift toward hybrid models integrating multi-scale processing, bridging the gap between computational vision and human cognition for applications in medical imaging,security, and beyond.△ Less

Title   : ShuffleV: A Microarchitectural Defense Strategy against Electromagnetic Side-Channel Attacks in Microprocessors
Source  : Submitted 14 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: The run-time electromagnetic (EM) emanation of microprocessors presents a side-channel that leaks the confidentiality of the applications running on them. Many recent works have demonstrated successful attacks leveraging such side-channels to extract the confidentiality of diverse applications, such as the key of cryptographic algorithms and the hyperparameter of neural network models. This paper proposes ShuffleV, a microarchitecture defense strategy against EM Side-Channel Attacks (SCAs). ShuffleV adopts the moving target defense (MTD) philosophy, by integrating hardware units to randomly shuffle the execution order of program instructions and optionally insert dummy instructions, to nullify the statistical observation by attackers across repetitive runs. We build ShuffleV on the open-source RISC-V core and provide six design options, to suit different application scenarios. To enable rapid evaluation, we develop a ShuffleV simulator that can help users to (1) simulate the performance overhead for each design option and (2) generate an execution trace to validate the randomness of execution on their workload. We implement ShuffleV on a Xilinx PYNQ-Z2 FPGA and validate its performance with two representative victim applications against EM SCAs, AES encryption, and neural network inference. The experimental results demonstrate that ShuffleV can provide automatic protection for these applications, without any user intervention or software modification.△ Less

Title   : High-efficiency and long-distance quantum memory-assisted device-independent quantum secret sharing with single photon sources
Source  : Submitted 14 October, 2025; v1 submitted 14 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: Quantum secret sharing (QSS) plays a critical role in building the distributed quantum networks. Device-independent (DI) QSS provides the highestsecuritylevel for QSS. However, the photon transmission loss and extremely low multipartite entanglement generation rate largely limit DI QSS'ssecurephoton transmission distance (less than 1 km) and practical key generation efficiency. To address the above drawbacks, we propose the quantum memory-assisted (QMA) DI QSS protocol based on single photon sources (SPSs). The single photons from the SPSs are used to construct long-distance multipartite entanglement channels with the help of the heraldedarchitecture. The heraldedarchitectureenables our protocol to have an infinitesecurephoton transmission distance in theory. The QMA technology can not only increase the multi-photon synchronization efficiency, but also optimize the photon transmittance to maximize the construction efficiency of the multipartite entanglement channels. Our protocol achieves the practical key generation efficiency seven orders of magnitude higher than that of the existing DI QSS protocols based on cascaded spontaneous parametric down-conversion sources and six orders of magnitude higher than that of the DI QSS based on SPSs without QMA. Our protocol has modular characteristics and is feasible under the current experimental technical conditions. Combining with the advanced random key generation basis strategy, the requirement on experimental devices can be effectively reduced. Our protocol is expected to promote the development of long-distance and high-efficiency DI quantum network in the future.△ Less

Title   : KoALA: KL-L0 Adversarial Detector via Label Agreement
Source  : Submitted 14 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: Deep neural networks are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, which pose significant risks tosecurity- and safety-critical applications. We present KoALA (KL-L0 Adversarial detection via Label Agreement), a novel, semantics-free adversarial detector that requires noarchitecturalchanges or adversarial retraining. KoALA operates on a simple principle: it detects an adversarial attack when class predictions from two complementary similarity metrics disagree. These metrics-KL divergence and an L0-based similarity-are specifically chosen to detect different types of perturbations. The KL divergence metric is sensitive to dense, low-amplitude shifts, while the L0-based similarity is designed for sparse, high-impact changes. We provide a formal proof of correctness for our approach. The only training required is a simple fine-tuning step on a pre-trained image encoder using clean images to ensure the embeddings align well with both metrics. This makes KOALA a lightweight, plug-and-play solution for existing models and various data modalities. Our extensive experiments on ResNet/CIFAR-10 and CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet confirm our theoretical claims. When the theorem's conditions are met, KoALA consistently and effectively detects adversarial examples. On the full test sets, KoALA achieves a precision of 0.94 and a recall of 0.81 on ResNet/CIFAR-10, and a precision of 0.66 and a recall of 0.85 on CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet.△ Less

Title   : QUICstep: Evaluating connection migration based QUIC censorship circumvention
Source  : Submitted 14 October, 2025; v1 submitted 3 April, 2023; originally announced April 2023.
Abstract: Internet censors often rely on information in the first few packets of a connection to censor unwanted traffic. With the rise of the QUIC transport protocol, prior work has suggested the method of using QUIC connection migration to conceal the first few handshake packets using a different network path (e.g., an encrypted proxy channel). However, the use of connection migration for censorship circumvention has not been explored or validated in terms of feasibility or performance. We bridge this gap by providing a rigorous quantitative evaluation of this approach that we name QUICstep. We develop a lightweight, application-agnostic prototype of QUICstep and demonstrate that QUICstep is able to circumvent a real-world QUIC SNI censor. We find that not only does QUICstep outperform a fully encrypted channel in diverse settings, but also that it can significantly reduce traffic load for encrypted channel providers. We also propose using QUICstep as a tool for measuring QUIC connection migration support in the wild and show that support for connection migration is on the rise. While as of now QUIC and connection migration support is limited, we envision that QUICstep can be a useful tool for the future where QUIC is the de facto norm for the Internet.△ Less

Title   : Noisy Neighbor: Exploiting RDMA for Resource Exhaustion Attacks in Containerized Clouds
Source  : Submitted 14 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: In modern containerized cloud environments, the adoption of RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) has expanded to reduce CPU overhead and enable high-performance data exchange. Achieving this requires strong performance isolation to ensure that one container's RDMA workload does not degrade the performance of others, thereby maintaining criticalsecurityassurances. However, existing isolation techniques are difficult to apply effectively due to the complexity of microarchitectural resource management within RDMA NICs (RNICs). This paper experimentally analyzes two types of resource exhaustion attacks on NVIDIA BlueField-3: (i) state saturation attacks and (ii) pipeline saturation attacks. Our results show that state saturation attacks can cause up to a 93.9% loss in bandwidth, a 1,117x increase in latency, and a 115% rise in cache misses for victim containers, while pipeline saturation attacks lead to severe link-level congestion and significant amplification, where small verb requests result in disproportionately high resource consumption. To mitigate these threats and restore predictablesecurityassurances, we propose HT-Verbs, a threshold-driven framework based on real-time per-container RDMA verb telemetry and adaptive resource classification that partitions RNIC resources into hot, warm, and cold tiers and throttles abusive workloads without requiring hardware modifications.△ Less

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital economy, data collaboration between organizations has become a well-established business model, driving the growth of various industries. However, privacy concerns make direct data sharing impractical. To address this, Two-Party Split Learning (a.k.a. Vertical Federated Learning (VFL)) has emerged as a promising solution forsecurecollaborative learning. Despite its advantages, thisarchitecturestill suffers from low computational resource utilization and training efficiency. Specifically, its synchronous dependency design increases training latency, while resource and data heterogeneity among participants further hinder efficient computation. To overcome these challenges, we propose PubSub-VFL, a novel VFL paradigm with a Publisher/Subscriberarchitectureoptimized for two-party collaborative learning with high computational efficiency. PubSub-VFL leverages the decoupling capabilities of the Pub/Subarchitectureand the data parallelism of the parameter serverarchitectureto design a hierarchical asynchronous mechanism, reducing training latency and improving system efficiency. Additionally, to mitigate the training imbalance caused by resource and data heterogeneity, we formalize an optimization problem based on participants' system profiles, enabling the selection of optimal hyperparameters while preserving privacy. We conduct a theoretical analysis to demonstrate that PubSub-VFL achieves stable convergence and is compatible withsecurityprotocols such as differential privacy. Extensive case studies on five benchmark datasets further validate its effectiveness, showing that, compared to state-of-the-art baselines, PubSub-VFL not only accelerates training by $2 \sim 7\times$ without compromising accuracy, but also achieves a computational resource utilization rate of up to 91.07%.△ Less

Abstract: This paper investigates systemic risk measures for stochastic financial networks of explicitly modelled bilateral liabilities. We extend the notion of systemic risk measures from Biagini, Fouque, Fritelli and Meyer-Brandis (2019) to graph structured data. In particular, we focus on an aggregation function that is derived from a market clearing algorithm proposed by Eisenberg and Noe (2001). In this setting, we show the existence of an optimal random allocation that distributes the overall minimal bailout capital andsecuresthe network. We study numerical methods for the approximation of systemic risk and optimal random allocations. We propose to use permutation equivariantarchitecturesof neural networks like graph neural networks (GNNs) and a class that we name (extended) permutation equivariant neural networks ((X)PENNs). We compare their performance to several benchmark allocations. The main feature of GNNs and (X)PENNs is that they are permutation equivariant with respect to the underlying graph data. In numerical experiments we find evidence that these permutation equivariant methods are superior to other approaches.△ Less

Title   : IP-Augmented Multi-Modal Malicious URL Detection Via Token-Contrastive Representation Enhancement and Multi-Granularity Fusion
Source  : Submitted 14 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: Malicious URL detection remains a critical cybersecurity challenge as adversaries increasingly employ sophisticated evasion techniques including obfuscation, character-level perturbations, and adversarial attacks. Although pre-trained language models (PLMs) like BERT have shown potential for URL analysis tasks, three limitations persist in current implementations: (1) inability to effectively model the non-natural hierarchical structure of URLs, (2) insufficient sensitivity to character-level obfuscation, and (3) lack of mechanisms to incorporate auxiliary network-level signals such as IP addresses-all essential for robust detection. To address these challenges, we propose CURL-IP, an advanced multi-modal detection framework incorporating three key innovations: (1) Token-Contrastive Representation Enhancer, which enhances subword token representations through token-aware contrastive learning to produce more discriminative and isotropic embeddings; (2) Cross-Layer Multi-Scale Aggregator, employing hierarchical aggregation of Transformer outputs via convolutional operations and gated MLPs to capture both local and global semantic patterns across layers; and (3) Blockwise Multi-Modal Coupler that decomposes URL-IP features into localized block units and computes cross-modal attention weights at the block level, enabling fine-grained inter-modal interaction. Thisarchitectureenables simultaneous preservation of fine-grained lexical cues, contextual semantics, and integration of network-level signals. Our evaluation on large-scale real-world datasets shows the framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across binary and multi-class classification tasks.△ Less

Source  : Submitted 14 October, 2025; v1 submitted 14 February, 2022; originally announced February 2022.
Abstract: Online voting is convenient and flexible, but amplifies the risks of voter coercion and vote buying. One promising mitigation strategy enables voters to give a coercer fake voting credentials, which silently cast votes that do not count. Current systems along these lines make problematic assumptions about credential issuance, however, such as strong trust in a registrar and/or in voter-controlled hardware, or expecting voters to interact with multiple registrars. Votegral is the first coercion-resistant votingarchitecturethat leverages the physicalsecurityof in-person registration to address these credential-issuance challenges, amortizing the convenience costs of in-person registration by reusing credentials across successive elections. Votegral's registration component, TRIP, gives voters a kiosk in a privacy booth with which to print real and fake credentials on paper, eliminating dependence on trusted hardware in credential issuance. The voter learns and can verify in the privacy booth which credential is real, but real and fake credentials thereafter appear indistinguishable to others. Only voters actually under coercion, a hopefully-rare case, need to trust the kiosk. To achieve verifiability, each paper credential encodes an interactive zero-knowledge proof, which is sound in real credentials but unsound in fake credentials. Voters observe the difference in the order of printing steps, but need not understand the technical details. Experimental results with our prototype suggest that Votegral is practical and sufficiently scalable for real-world elections. User-visible latency of credential issuance in TRIP is at most 19.7 seconds even on resource-constrained kiosk hardware. A companion usability study indicates that TRIP's usability is competitive with other e-voting systems, and formal proofs support TRIP's combination of coercion-resistance and verifiability.△ Less

Abstract: Code review is an essential process to ensure the quality of software that identifies potential software issues at an early stage of software development. Among all software issues,securityissues are the most important to identify, as they can easily lead to severe software crashes and service disruptions. Recent research efforts have been devoted to automated approaches to reduce the manual efforts required in thesecurecode review process. Despite the progress, current automated approaches onsecurecode review, including static analysis, deep learning models, and prompting approaches, still face the challenges of limited precision and coverage, and a lack of comprehensive evaluation.
  To mitigate these challenges, we propose iCodeReviewer, which is an automatedsecurecode review approach based on large language models (LLMs). iCodeReviewer leverages a novel mixture-of-promptsarchitecturethat incorporates many prompt experts to improve the coverage ofsecurityissues. Each prompt expert is a dynamic prompt pipeline to check the existence of a specificsecurityissue. iCodeReviewer also implements an effective routing algorithm to activate only necessary prompt experts based on the code features in the input program, reducing the false positives induced by LLM hallucination. Experiment results in our internal dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of iCodeReviewer insecurityissue identification and localization with an F1 of 63.98%. The review comments generated by iCodeReviewer also achieve a high acceptance rate up to 84% when it is deployed in production environments.△ Less

Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) algorithms have shown promising results in robotic manipulation tasks, but their vulnerability to offline universal perturbation attacks remains underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive study of adversarial attacks on both classic and recently proposed algorithms, including Behavior Cloning (BC), LSTM-GMM, Implicit Behavior Cloning (IBC), Diffusion Policy (DP), and Vector-Quantizied Behavior Transformer (VQ-BET). We study the vulnerability of these methods to universal adversarial perturbations. Our experiments on several simulated robotic manipulation tasks reveal that most of the current methods are highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. We also show that these attacks are often transferable across algorithms,architectures, and tasks, raising concerningsecurityvulnerabilities to black-box attacks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present a systematic study of the vulnerabilities of different LfD algorithms to both white-box and black-box attacks.

Title   : Over-Threshold Multiparty Private Set Intersection for Collaborative Network Intrusion Detection
Source  : Submitted 13 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: An important function of collaborative network intrusion detection is to analyze the network logs of the collaborators for joint IP addresses. However, sharing IP addresses in plain is sensitive and may be even subject to privacy legislation as it is personally identifiable information. In this paper, we present the privacy-preserving collection of IP addresses. We propose a single collector, over-threshold private set intersection protocol. In this protocol $N$ participants identify the IP addresses that appear in at least $t$ participant's sets without revealing any information about other IP addresses. Using a novel hashing scheme, we reduce the computational complexity of the previous state-of-the-art solution from $O(M(N \log{M}/t)^{2t})$ to $O(t^2M\binom{N}{t})$, where $M$ denotes the dataset size. This reduction makes it practically feasible to apply our protocol to real network logs. We test our protocol using joint networks logs of multiple institutions. Additionally, we present two deployment options: a collusion-safe deployment, which provides strongersecurityguarantees at the cost of increased communication overhead, and a non-interactive deployment, which assumes a non-colluding collector but offers significantly lower communication costs and applicable to many use cases of collaborative network intrusion detection similar to ours.△ Less

Title   : Countermind: A Multi-LayeredSecurityArchitecturefor Large Language Models
Source  : Submitted 13 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: Thesecurityof Large Language Model (LLM) applications is fundamentally challenged by "form-first" attacks like prompt injection and jailbreaking, where malicious instructions are embedded within user inputs. Conventional defenses, which rely on post hoc output filtering, are often brittle and fail to address the root cause: the model's inability to distinguish trusted instructions from untrusted data. This paper proposes Countermind, a multi-layeredsecurityarchitectureintended to shift defenses from a reactive, post hoc posture to a proactive, pre-inference, and intra-inference enforcement model. Thearchitectureproposes a fortified perimeter designed to structurally validate and transform all inputs, and an internal governance mechanism intended to constrain the model's semantic processing pathways before an output is generated. The primary contributions of this work are conceptual designs for: (1) A Semantic Boundary Logic (SBL) with a mandatory, time-coupled Text Crypter intended to reduce the plaintext prompt injection attack surface, provided all ingestion paths are enforced. (2) A Parameter-Space Restriction (PSR) mechanism, leveraging principles from representation engineering, to dynamically control the LLM's access to internal semantic clusters, with the goal of mitigating semantic drift and dangerous emergent behaviors. (3) ASecure, Self-Regulating Core that uses an OODA loop and a learningsecuritymodule to adapt its defenses based on an immutable audit log. (4) A Multimodal Input Sandbox and Context-Defense mechanisms to address threats from non-textual data and long-term semantic poisoning. This paper outlines an evaluation plan designed to quantify the proposedarchitecture'seffectiveness in reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) for form-first attacks and to measure its potential latency overhead.△ Less

Title   : BlackIce: A Containerized Red Teaming Toolkit for AISecurityTesting
Source  : Submitted 13 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: AI models are being increasingly integrated into real-world systems, raising significant concerns about their safety andsecurity. Consequently, AI red teaming has become essential for organizations to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by adversaries. While numerous AI red teaming tools currently exist, practitioners face challenges in selecting the most appropriate tools from a rapidly expanding landscape, as well as managing complex and frequently conflicting software dependencies across isolated projects. Given these challenges and the relatively small number of organizations with dedicated AI red teams, there is a strong need to lower barriers to entry and establish a standardized environment that simplifies the setup and execution of comprehensive AI model assessments.
  Inspired by Kali Linux's role in traditional penetration testing, we introduce BlackIce, an open-source containerized toolkit designed for red teaming Large Language Models (LLMs) and classical machine learning (ML) models. BlackIce provides a reproducible, version-pinned Docker image that bundles 14 carefully selected open-source tools for Responsible AI andSecuritytesting, all accessible via a unified command-line interface. With this setup, initiating red team assessments is as straightforward as launching a container, either locally or using a cloud platform. Additionally, the image's modulararchitecturefacilitates community-driven extensions, allowing users to easily adapt or expand the toolkit as new threats emerge. In this paper, we describe thearchitectureof the container image, the process used for selecting tools, and the types of evaluations they support.△ Less

Title   : Systematic Prevention of On-Core Timing Channels by Full Temporal Partitioning
Source  : Submitted 13 October, 2025; v1 submitted 24 February, 2022; originally announced February 2022.
Abstract: Microarchitectural timing channels enable unwanted information flow acrosssecurityboundaries, violating fundamentalsecurityassumptions. They leverage timing variations of several state-holding microarchitectural components and have been demonstrated across instruction setarchitecturesand hardware implementations. Analogously to memory protection, Ge et al. have proposed time protection for preventing information leakage via timing channels. They also showed that time protection calls for hardware support. This work leverages the open and extensible RISC-V instruction setarchitecture(ISA) to introduce the temporal fence instruction fence.t, which provides the required mechanisms by clearing vulnerable microarchitectural state and guaranteeing a history-independent context-switch latency. We propose and discuss three different implementations of fence.t and implement them on an experimental version of the seL4 microkernel and CVA6, an open-source, in-order, application class, 64-bit RISC-V core. We find that a complete, systematic, ISA-supported erasure of all non-architecturalcore components is the most effective implementation while featuring a low implementation effort, a minimal performance overhead of less than 1%, and negligible hardware costs.△ Less

Title   : Mon CHÉRI: Mitigating Uninitialized Memory Access with Conditional Capabilities
Source  : Submitted 13 October, 2025; v1 submitted 11 July, 2024; originally announced July 2024.
Abstract: Up to 10% of memory-safety vulnerabilities in languages like C and C++ stem from uninitialized variables. This work addresses the prevalence and lack of adequate software mitigations for uninitialized memory issues, proposingarchitecturalprotections in hardware. Capability-based addressing, such as the University of Cambridge's CHERI, mitigates many memory defects, including spatial and temporal safety violations at anarchitecturallevel. CHERI, however, does not handle undefined behavior from uninitialized variables. We extend the CHERI capability model to include "conditional capabilities", enabling memory-access policies based on prior operations. This allows enforcement of policies that satisfy memory-safety objectives such as "no reads to memory without at least one prior write" (Write-before-Read). We present ourarchitectureextension, compiler support, and detailed evaluation of our approach on the QEMU full-system simulator and a modified FPGA-based CHERI-RISCV softcore. Our evaluation shows conditional capabilities are practical, with high detection accuracy while adding a small (~3.5%) overhead which is comparable to the cost of baseline CHERI capabilities.△ Less

Title   : Bitcoin: A Non-Continuous Time System
Source  : Submitted 13 October, 2025; v1 submitted 19 January, 2025; originally announced January 2025.
Abstract: Bitcoin operates as a decentralized system that constructs temporal order internally rather than synchronizing to external clocks. Empirical analysis shows that its time evolution is non-continuous, probabilistic, and self-regulating. Block generation follows a stochastic process driven by independent hash trials, while forks and rollbacks introduce local discontinuities that are resolved through the longest-chain rule. We model this process as an information entropy feedback loop in which uncertainty rises during block search and collapses instantaneously upon block discovery. Difficulty adjustment maintains the network near the entropy-maximizing regime, allowing it to infer the hidden global variable of total hash rate and to regulate its own rhythm without unified external coordination. Together, proof of work as an entropy field, difficulty adjustment, entropy collapse, and recursive sealing constitute the Bitcoin time mechanism, a self-referential temporalarchitecturethat transforms distributed randomness into discrete and irreversible events. The proposed framework reveals Bitcoin as an entropy-driven timing system, providing a theoretical foundation for constructing permissionless networks with autonomous temporal regulation.△ Less

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach towards image authentication and tampering detection by using watermarking as a communication channel for semantic information.

Our method improves significantly robustness on both malign and benign edits. We also introduce a local confidence metric correlated with Message Recovery Rate, enhancing the method's practical applicability. This approach bridges the gap between traditional watermarking and passive forensic methods, offering a robust solution for image integrity verification.△ Less

Title   : TDADL-IE: A Deep Learning-Driven CryptographicArchitecturefor Medical ImageSecurity
Source  : Submitted 13 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: The rise of digital medical imaging, like MRI and CT, demands strong encryption to protect patient data in telemedicine and cloud storage. Chaotic systems are popular for image encryption due to their sensitivity and unique characteristics, but existing methods often lack sufficientsecurity. This paper presents the Three-dimensional Diffusion Algorithm and Deep Learning Image Encryption system (TDADL-IE), built on three key elements. First, we propose an enhanced chaotic generator using an LSTM network with a 1D-Sine Quadratic Chaotic Map (1D-SQCM) for better pseudorandom sequence generation. Next, a new three-dimensional diffusion algorithm (TDA) is applied to encrypt permuted images. TDADL-IE is versatile for images of any size. Experiments confirm its effectiveness against varioussecuritythreats. The code is available at \href{https://github.com/QuincyQAQ/TDADL-IE}{https://github.com/QuincyQAQ/TDADL-IE}.△ Less

Title   : IM-PIR: In-Memory Private Information Retrieval
Source  : Submitted 13 October, 2025; v1 submitted 8 September, 2025; originally announced September 2025.
Abstract: Private information retrieval (PIR) is a cryptographic primitive that allows a client tosecurelyquery one or multiple servers without revealing their specific interests. In spite of their strongsecurityguarantees, current PIR constructions are computationally costly. Specifically, most PIR implementations are memory-bound due to the need to scan extensive databases (in the order of GB), making them inherently constrained by the limited memory bandwidth in traditional processor-centric computingarchitectures. Processing-in-memory (PIM) is an emerging computing paradigm that augments memory with compute capabilities, addressing the memory bandwidth bottleneck while simultaneously providing extensive parallelism. Recent research has demonstrated PIM's potential to significantly improve performance across a range of data-intensive workloads, including graph processing, genome analysis, and machine learning.
  In this work, we propose the first PIM-basedarchitecturefor multi-server PIR. We discuss the algorithmic foundations of the latter and show how its operations align with the core strengths of PIMarchitectures: extensive parallelism and high memory bandwidth. Based on this observation, we design and implement IM-PIR, a PIM-based multi-server PIR approach on top of UPMEM PIM, the first openly commercialized PIMarchitecture. Our evaluation demonstrates that a PIM-based multi-server PIR implementation significantly improves query throughput by more than 3.7x when compared to a standard CPU-based PIR approach.△ Less

Title   : Visible Light Communication for Vehicular Networks: A Tutorial
Source  : Submitted 13 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: The advent of the fifth-generation technology promises to bring about more vertical applications and emerging services that include vehicular networks and intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). To achieve their vision of real-time and safetyapplications, vehicular networks rely on short-range to medium-range communications. One emerging technology that aims to provide reliability and high-data rate in short-range communications is the visible light communications (VLC). Due to its remarkable advantages, some studies have recently investigated the integration of VLC in vehicular networks and ITSs. Despite their attractive features, such networks also face several implementation issues. This paper provides an extended tutorial on the implementation of VLC-based vehicular networks. To begin with, we present the implementation characteristics of these systems and discuss some related issues. The underlying system considers a general structure with transmitters, channels, and receivers based on photodetectors and cameras, as well as standardization efforts and types of topologies. In addition, we discuss the impact of the sun and artificial light sources, flickering, dimming, throughput enhancement, uplinksecurity, and mobility on practical implementation. Finally, we highlight some key challenges and potential solutions and provide some directions for future research investigations that could constitute an advancement toward the development of commercial VLC-based vehicular systems.△ Less

Title   : Radar and Acoustic Sensor Fusion using a Transformer Encoder for Robust Drone Detection and Classification
Source  : Submitted 13 October, 2025; v1 submitted 26 July, 2025; originally announced July 2025.
Abstract: The use of drones in a wide range of applications is steadily increasing. However, this has also raised criticalsecurityconcerns such as unauthorized drone intrusions into restricted zones. Therefore, robust and accurate drone detection and classification mechanisms are required despite significant challenges due to small size of drones, low-altitude flight, and environmental noise. In this letter, we propose a multi-modal approach combining radar and acoustic sensing for detecting and classifying drones. We employ radar due to its long-range capabilities, and robustness to different weather conditions. We utilize raw acoustic signals without converting them to other domains such as spectrograms or Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. This enables us to use fewer number of parameters compared to the stateof-the-art approaches. Furthermore, we explore the effectiveness of the transformer encoderarchitecturein fusing these sensors. Experimental results obtained in outdoor settings verify the superior performance of the proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art methods.△ Less

Title   : The Hidden DNA of LLM-Generated JavaScript: Structural Patterns Enable High-Accuracy Authorship Attribution

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first large-scale study exploring whether JavaScript code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) can reveal which model produced it, enabling reliable authorship attribution and model fingerprinting. With the rapid rise of AI-generated code, attribution is playing a critical role in detecting vulnerabilities, flagging malicious content, and ensuring accountability. While AI-vs-human detection usually treats AI as a single category we show that individual LLMs leave unique stylistic signatures, even among models belonging to the same family or parameter size. To this end, we introduce LLM-NodeJS, a dataset of 50,000 Node.js back-end programs from 20 large language models. Each has four transformed variants, yielding 250,000 unique JavaScript samples and two additional representations (JSIR and AST) for diverse research applications. Using this dataset, we benchmark traditional machine learning classifiers against fine-tuned Transformer encoders and introduce CodeT5-JSA, a customarchitecturederived from the 770M-parameter CodeT5 model with its decoder removed and a modified classification head. It achieves 95.8% accuracy on five-class attribution, 94.6% on ten-class, and 88.5% on twenty-class tasks, surpassing other tested models such as BERT, CodeBERT, and Longformer. We demonstrate that classifiers capture deeper stylistic regularities in program dataflow and structure, rather than relying on surface-level features. As a result, attribution remains effective even after mangling, comment removal, and heavy code transformations. To support open science and reproducibility, we release the LLM-NodeJS dataset, Google Colab training scripts, and all related materials on GitHub: https://github.com/LLM-NodeJS-dataset.△ Less

Title   : Stablecoins and the Emerging Hybrid Monetary Ecosystems
Source  : Submitted 12 October, 2025; v1 submitted 16 May, 2025; originally announced May 2025.
Abstract: With market capitalization exceeding USD250 billion by mid-2025, stablecoins have evolved from a crypto-focused innovation into a vital component of the global monetary structure. This paper identifies the characteristics of stablecoins from an analytical perspective and investigates the role of stablecoins in forming a hybrid monetary ecosystem where public (fiat, CBDC) and private (USDC, USDT, DAI) monies coexist. Through a number of econometric analysis models, we find that stablecoins maintain strong peg stability, while each type exhibiting distinctive responses to market variables such as trading volume and capitalization depending on the mechanisms behind. We also introduce a hybrid system design that proposes a two-layer structure, which private stablecoin issuers are backed by central bank reserves, ensuring uniformity,security, and programmability. This model takes advantages of both decentralized finance and payment innovation, while utilizing the Federal Reserve's institutional trust. A case study on the SVB-USDC de-peg event in 2023 illustrates how such a hybrid system could have prevented panic-induced instability through transparent reserves,securedliquidity, and interoperable assets. Through examination of the Dybvig model and simulation, we conclude that a hybrid monetary model not only enhances financial inclusivity, scalability, and dollar utility in digital ecosystems, but it also strengthens systemic resilience, offering a credible blueprint for future digital dollararchitectures.△ Less

Title   : MGPATH: Vision-Language Model with Multi-Granular Prompt Learning for Few-Shot WSI Classification
Source  : Submitted 11 October, 2025; v1 submitted 11 February, 2025; originally announced February 2025.
Abstract: Whole slide pathology image classification presents challenges due to gigapixel image sizes and limited annotation labels, hindering model generalization. This paper introduces a prompt learning method to adapt large vision-language models for few-shot pathology classification. We first extend the Prov-GigaPath vision foundation model, pre-trained on 1.3 billion pathology image tiles, into a vision-language model by adding adaptors and aligning it with medical text encoders via contrastive learning on 923K image-text pairs. The model is then used to extract visual features and text embeddings from few-shot annotations and fine-tunes with learnable prompt embeddings. Unlike prior methods that combine prompts with frozen features using prefix embeddings or self-attention, we propose multi-granular attention that compares interactions between learnable prompts with individual image patches and groups of them. This approach improves the model's ability to capture both fine-grained details and broader context, enhancing its recognition of complex patterns across sub-regions. To further improve accuracy, we leverage (unbalanced) optimal transport-based visual-text distance tosecuremodel robustness by mitigating perturbations that might occur during the data augmentation process. Empirical experiments on lung, kidney, and breast pathology modalities validate the effectiveness of our approach; thereby, we surpass several of the latest competitors and consistently improve performance across diversearchitectures, including CLIP, PLIP, and Prov-GigaPath integrated PLIP.△ Less

Title   : The Achilles' Heel of LLMs: How Altering a Handful of Neurons Can Cripple Language Abilities
Source  : Submitted 11 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational tools in natural language processing, powering a wide range of applications and research. Many studies have shown that LLMs share significant similarities with the human brain. Recent neuroscience research has found that a small subset of biological neurons in the human brain are crucial for core cognitive functions, which raises a fundamental question: do LLMs also contain a small subset of critical neurons? In this paper, we investigate this question by proposing a Perturbation-based Causal Identification of Critical Neurons method to systematically locate such critical neurons in LLMs. Our findings reveal three key insights: (1) LLMs contain ultra-sparse critical neuron sets. Disrupting these critical neurons can cause a 72B-parameter model with over 1.1 billion neurons to completely collapse, with perplexity increasing by up to 20 orders of magnitude; (2) These critical neurons are not uniformly distributed, but tend to concentrate in the outer layers, particularly within the MLP down\_proj components; (3) Performance degradation exhibits sharp phase transitions, rather than a gradual decline, when these critical neurons are disrupted. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse modelarchitecturesand scales, we provide deeper analysis of these phenomena and their implications for LLM robustness and interpretability. These findings can offer guidance for developing more robust modelarchitecturesand improving deploymentsecurityin safety-critical applications.△ Less

Abstract: Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs) present unique challenges due to high node mobility, dynamic topologies, and strict resource constraints. Existing routing protocols often optimize for a single metric, such as path length or energy, while neglecting the complex dependencies between network performance,security, and MAC layer efficiency. This paper introduces a novel hardware software co design framework forsecureand adaptive UAV swarm communications, featuring an energy aware protocol stack. Thearchitectureemploys a multicast, clustered organization where routing decisions integrate dynamic trust scores, historical link quality, and internodal distance. A hybrid MAC protocol combines contention based and scheduled channel access for optimized throughput.Securityis ensured through a zero trust model that fuses cryptographic authentication with a behavioral reputation system, alongside hardware accelerated AES GCM encryption. Comparative analysis in an NS 3 simulation environment demonstrates the framework's superiority in packet delivery ratio, latency, resilience, and overhead, providing a scalable foundation for high performance swarm operations.△ Less

Title   : GI-NAS: Boosting Gradient Inversion Attacks Through Adaptive NeuralArchitectureSearch
Source  : Submitted 11 October, 2025; v1 submitted 31 May, 2024; originally announced May 2024.
Abstract: Gradient Inversion Attacks invert the transmitted gradients in Federated Learning (FL) systems to reconstruct the sensitive data of local clients and have raised considerable privacy concerns. A majority of gradient inversion methods rely heavily on explicit prior knowledge (e.g., a well pre-trained generative model), which is often unavailable in realistic scenarios. This is because real-world client data distributions are often highly heterogeneous, domain-specific, and unavailable to attackers, making it impractical for attackers to obtain perfectly matched pre-trained models, which inevitably suffer from fundamental distribution shifts relative to target private data. To alleviate this issue, researchers have proposed to leverage the implicit prior knowledge of an over-parameterized network. However, they only utilize a fixed neuralarchitecturefor all the attack settings. This would hinder the adaptive use of implicitarchitecturalpriors and consequently limit the generalizability. In this paper, we further exploit such implicit prior knowledge by proposing Gradient Inversion via NeuralArchitectureSearch (GI-NAS), which adaptively searches the network and captures the implicit priors behind neuralarchitectures. Extensive experiments verify that our proposed GI-NAS can achieve superior attack performance compared to state-of-the-art gradient inversion methods, even under more practical settings with high-resolution images, large-sized batches, and advanced defense strategies. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to successfully introduce NAS to the gradient inversion community. We believe that this work exposes critical vulnerabilities in real-world federated learning by demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction of sensitive data without requiring domain-specific priors, forcing urgent reassessment of FL privacy safeguards.△ Less

Abstract: We propose the first unified adversarial attack benchmark for Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs), named GenoArmory. Unlike existing GFM benchmarks, GenoArmory offers the first comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the vulnerability of GFMs to adversarial attacks. Methodologically, we evaluate the adversarial robustness of five state-of-the-art GFMs using four widely adopted attack algorithms and three defense strategies. Importantly, our benchmark provides an accessible and comprehensive framework to analyze GFM vulnerabilities with respect to modelarchitecture, quantization schemes, and training datasets. Additionally, we introduce GenoAdv, a new adversarial sample dataset designed to improve GFM safety. Empirically, classification models exhibit greater robustness to adversarial perturbations compared to generative models, highlighting the impact of task type on model vulnerability. Moreover, adversarial attacks frequently target biologically significant genomic regions, suggesting that these models effectively capture meaningful sequence features.△ Less

Source  : Submitted 11 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: We present SLEAN (Simple Lightweight Ensemble Analysis Network), a deterministic framework for coordinating multiple LLM providers through text-based prompt orchestration. Unlike complex multi-agent systems requiring specialized infrastructure, SLEAN operates as a simple prompt bridge between LLMs using .txt templates, requiring no deep technical knowledge for deployment. The three-phase protocol formed by independent analysis, cross-critique, and arbitration, filters harmful AI-generated code suggestions before production deployment, addressing how AI-assisted debugging increasingly produces modifications that introduce unnecessary complexity, break existing functionality, or address problems. Evaluating 15 software bugs, we analyzed 69 AI-generated fix propositions. SLEAN's filtering accepted 22 fixes (31.9%, 95% CI 20.9-42.9%) while rejecting 47 that would have been harmful if applied verbatim. The arbitration process reduced code change surface by 83-90% relative to raw AI outputs, enforcing minimal causal edits over scope-expanding modifications. Minimal Type 2 inputs proved more efficient than detailed Type 1 inputs, requiring 2.85 versus 3.56 propositions per accepted fix (35.1% versus 28.1% acceptance, about a 20% efficiency gain). Agreement between AI systems showed weak correlation with fix quality: high convergence (at least 80%) occurred in 4 of 15 cases and improved acceptance by only 2.4% points; arbitration appeared only at exactly 10% convergence in 2 of 15 cases, although low convergence alone did not necessitate arbitration. The file-driven, provider-agnosticarchitectureenables deployment without specialized coding expertise, making it applicable tosecurityauditing, code review, document verification, and other domains requiring reliable multi-provider synthesis with end-to-end auditability.△ Less

Title   : RIPRAG: Hack a Black-box Retrieval-Augmented Generation Question-Answering System with Reinforcement Learning
Source  : Submitted 11 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a core technology for tasks such as question-answering (QA) and content generation. However, by injecting poisoned documents into the database of RAG systems, attackers can manipulate LLMs to generate text that aligns with their intended preferences. Existing research has primarily focused on white-box attacks against simplified RAGarchitectures. In this paper, we investigate a more complex and realistic scenario: the attacker lacks knowledge of the RAG system's internal composition and implementation details, and the RAG system comprises components beyond a mere retriever. Specifically, we propose the RIPRAG attack framework, an end-to-end attack pipeline that treats the target RAG system as a black box, where the only information accessible to the attacker is whether the poisoning succeeds. Our method leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize the generation model for poisoned documents, ensuring that the generated poisoned document aligns with the target RAG system's preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that this method can effectively execute poisoning attacks against most complex RAG systems, achieving an attack success rate (ASR) improvement of up to 0.72 compared to baseline methods. This highlights prevalent deficiencies in current defensive methods and provides critical insights for LLMsecurityresearch.△ Less

Title   : Fine-grained CDN Delegation
Source  : Submitted 10 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: The use of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) has significantly increased over the past decade, with approximately 55 million websites currently relying on CDN services. Emerging solutions, such as Delegated Credentials (RFC 9345), lack fine-grained definitions of many critical aspects of delegation, such as the length of delegation chains, revocation mechanism, permitted operations, and a well-defined scope for said delegation. We present Delegation Certificates (DeCerts), which modify X.509 certificate standard and add new extensions to enable fine-grained CDN delegation. DeCerts allow domain owners to specify delegated and non-delegated subdomains, and control the depth of delegation extended by CDNs, which provides flexibility in delegation management. But more importantly, DeCerts are built on a new principle which provides full autonomy to domain owners-domain owners can issue DeCerts fully independent of Certificate Authorities (CAs), and thus have greater flexibility in policy control, including revocation methods. Such level of flexibility would be hard to match if CAs where to issue such certificates. Revoking a DeCert revokes delegation. We discuss multiple revocation mechanisms for a DeCerts balancingsecurity, performance, and delegator control. We modify Firefox to support DeCert (i.e., proper validation) as a proof-of-concept, and test it to demonstrate the feasibility, compatibility of DeCerts with browsers and TLS/HTTPS protocols. DeCerts enhance thesecurity, scalability, and manageability of CDN delegation, offering a practical solution for Internet services.△ Less

Abstract: Effective analysis of cybersecurity and threat intelligence data demands language models that can interpret specialized terminology, complex document structures, and the interdependence of natural language and source code. Encoder-only transformerarchitecturesprovide efficient and robust representations that support critical tasks such as semantic search, technical entity extraction, and semantic analysis, which are key to automated threat detection, incident triage, and vulnerability assessment. However, general-purpose language models often lack the domain-specific adaptation required for high precision. We present SecureBERT 2.0, an enhanced encoder-only language model purpose-built for cybersecurity applications. Leveraging the ModernBERTarchitecture, SecureBERT 2.0 introduces improved long-context modeling and hierarchical encoding, enabling effective processing of extended and heterogeneous documents, including threat reports and source code artifacts. Pretrained on a domain-specific corpus more than thirteen times larger than its predecessor, comprising over 13 billion text tokens and 53 million code tokens from diverse real-world sources, SecureBERT 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple cybersecurity benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in semantic search for threat intelligence, semantic analysis, cybersecurity-specific named entity recognition, and automated vulnerability detection in code within the cybersecurity domain.△ Less

Title   : The Data Enclave Advantage: A New Paradigm for Least-Privileged Data Access in a Zero-Trust World
Source  : Submitted 10 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: As cloud infrastructure evolves to support dynamic and distributed workflows, accelerated now by AI-driven processes, the outdated model of standing permissions has become a critical vulnerability. Based on the CloudSecurityAlliance (CSA) Top Threats to Cloud Computing Deep Dive 2025 Report, our analysis details how standing permissions cause catastrophic cloud breaches. While currentsecuritytools are addressing network and APIsecurity, the challenge ofsecuringgranular data access remains. Removing standing permissions at the data level is as critical as it is at the network level, especially for companies handling valuable data at scale.
  In this white paper, we introduce an innovativearchitecturebased on on-demand data enclaves to address this gap directly. Our approach enables Zero Standing Privilege (ZSP) and Just-in-Time (JIT) principles at the data level. We replace static permissions with temporary data contracts that enforce proactive protection. This means separation is built around the data requested on-demand, providing precise access and real time monitoring for individual records instead of datasets. This solution drastically reduces the attack surface, prevents privilege creep, and simplifies auditing, offering a vital path for enterprises to transition to a moresecureand resilient data environment.△ Less

Title   : Systematic Assessment of Cache Timing Vulnerabilities on RISC-V Processors

Abstract: While interest in the open RISC-V instruction setarchitectureis growing, tools to assess thesecurityof concrete processor implementations are lacking. There are dedicated tools and benchmarks for common microarchitectural side-channel vulnerabilities for popular processor families such as Intel x86-64 or ARM, but not for RISC-V. In this paper we describe our efforts in porting an Intel x86-64 benchmark suite for cache-based timing vulnerabilities to RISC-V. We then use this benchmark to evaluate thesecurityof three commercially available RISC-V processors, the T-Head C910 and the SiFive U54 and U74 cores. We observe that the C910 processor exhibits more distinct timing types than the other processors, leading to the assumption that code running on the C910 would be exposed to more microarchitectural vulnerability sources. In addition, our evaluation reveals that $65.9\%$ of the vulnerabilities covered by the benchmark exist in all processors, while only $6.8\%$ are absent from all cores. Our work, in particular the ported benchmark, aims to support RISC-V processor designers to identify leakage sources early in their designs and to support the development of countermeasures.△ Less

Title   : Modern iOSSecurityFeatures -- A Deep Dive into SPTM, TXM, and Exclaves
Source  : Submitted 10 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: The XNU kernel is the basis of Apple's operating systems. Although labeled as a hybrid kernel, it is found to generally operate in a monolithic manner by defining a single privileged trust zone in which all system functionality resides. This hassecurityimplications, as a kernel compromise has immediate and significant effects on the entire system. Over the past few years, Apple has taken steps towards a more compartmentalized kernelarchitectureand a more microkernel-like design. To date, there has been no scientific discussion of SPTM and relatedsecuritymechanisms. Therefore, the understanding of the system and the underlyingsecuritymechanisms is minimal. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of newsecuritymechanisms and their interplay, and create the first conclusive writeup considering all current mitigations. SPTM acts as the sole authority regarding memory retyping. Our analysis reveals that, through SPTM domains based on frame retyping and memory mapping rule sets, SPTM introduces domains of trust into the system, effectively gapping different functionalities from one another. Gapped functionality includes the TXM, responsible for code signing and entitlement verification. We further demonstrate how this introduction lays the groundwork for the most recentsecurityfeature of Exclaves, and conduct an in-depth analysis of its communication mechanisms. We discover multifold ways of communication, most notably xnuproxy as asecureworld request handler, and the Tightbeam IPC framework. Thearchitecturechanges are found to increase systemsecurity, with key and sensitive components being moved out of XNU's direct reach. This also provides additionalsecurityguarantees in the event of a kernel compromise, which is no longer an immediate threat at the highest trust level.△ Less

Title   : Federated Data Analytics for Cancer Immunotherapy: A Privacy-Preserving Collaborative Platform for Patient Management
Source  : Submitted 10 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: Connected health is a multidisciplinary approach focused on health management, prioritizing pa-tient needs in the creation of tools, services, and treatments. This paradigm ensures proactive and efficient care by facilitating the timely exchange of accurate patient information among all stake-holders in the care continuum. The rise of digital technologies and process innovations promises to enhance connected health by integrating various healthcare data sources. This integration aims to personalize care, predict health outcomes, and streamline patient management, though challeng-es remain, particularly in dataarchitecture, application interoperability, andsecurity. Data analytics can provide critical insights for informed decision-making and health co-creation, but solutions must prioritize end-users, including patients and healthcare professionals. This perspective was explored through an agile System Development Lifecycle in an EU-funded project aimed at developing an integrated AI-generated solution for managing cancer patients undergoing immunotherapy. This paper contributes with a collaborative digital framework integrating stakeholders across the care continuum, leveraging federated big data analytics and artificial intelligence for improved decision-making while ensuring privacy. Analytical capabilities, such as treatment recommendations and adverse event predictions, were validated using real-life data, achieving 70%-90% accuracy in a pilot study with the medical partners, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness.△ Less

Title   : URLLC for 6G Enabled Industry 5.0: A Taxonomy ofArchitectures, Cross Layer Techniques, and Time Critical Applications
Source  : Submitted 10 October, 2025; v1 submitted 9 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: The evolution from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0 introduces stringent requirements for ultra reliable low latency communication (URLLC) to support human centric, intelligent, and resilient industrial systems. Sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks aim to meet these requirements through sub-millisecond end-to-end delays, microsecond level jitter, and near perfect reliability, enabled by advances such as terahertz (THz) communication, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), multi-access edge computing (MEC), and AI driven cross layer optimization. This paper presents a comprehensive review of URLLC solutions for 6G enabled industry 5.0, organized into a structured taxonomy including application domains, key technical enablers, design challenges, and performance enhancements. The survey examines emerging approaches, including digital twin integration, AI/ML based resource orchestration, Network Function Virtualization (NFV) enabled service function chaining, and cross domain networking, while mapping them to critical industrial scenarios such as smart manufacturing, connected healthcare, autonomous mobility, remote control, and next-generation mobile networks. Performance trade-offs between latency, reliability, scalability, and energy efficiency are analyzed in the context of representative state-of-the-art studies. Finally, the paper identifies open challenges and outlines future research directions to realize deterministic,secure, and sustainable URLLCarchitecturesfor Industry 5.0.△ Less

Title   : A Scalable, Privacy-Preserving Decentralized Identity and Verifiable Data Sharing Framework based on Zero-Knowledge Proofs
Source  : Submitted 10 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: With the proliferation of decentralized applications (DApps), the conflict between the transparency of blockchain technology and user data privacy has become increasingly prominent. While Decentralized Identity (DID) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) provide a standardized framework for user data sovereignty, achieving trusted identity verification and data sharing without compromising privacy remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel, comprehensive framework that integrates DIDs and VCs with efficient Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) schemes to address this core issue. The key contributions of this framework are threefold: first, it constructs a set of strong privacy-preserving protocols based on zk-STARKs, allowing users to prove that their credentials satisfy specific conditions (e.g., "age is over 18") without revealing any underlying sensitive data. Second, it designs a scalable, privacy-preserving credential revocation mechanism based on cryptographic accumulators, effectively solving credential management challenges in large-scale scenarios. Finally, it integrates a practical social key recovery scheme, significantly enhancing system usability andsecurity. Through a prototype implementation and performance evaluation, this paper quantitatively analyzes the framework's performance in terms of proof generation time, verification overhead, and on-chain costs. Compared to existing state-of-the-art systems based on zk-SNARKs, our framework, at the cost of a larger proof size, significantly improves prover efficiency for complex computations and provides strongersecurityguarantees, including no trusted setup and post-quantumsecurity. Finally, a case study in the decentralized finance (DeFi) credit scoring scenario demonstrates the framework's immense potential for unlocking capital efficiency and fostering a trusted data economy.△ Less

Title   : Future G Network's New Reality: Opportunities andSecurityChallenges
Source  : Submitted 10 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: Future G network's new reality is a widespread cyber-physical environment created by Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC). It is a crucial technology that transforms wireless connections into ubiquitous sensors. ISAC unlocks transformative new capabilities, powering autonomous systems, augmented human sensing, and next-generation immersive applications, such as digital twins. However, this new reality fundamentally reshapes thesecuritylandscape. The primarysecurityconcern shifts from the traditional focus on data protection to a new priority: safeguarding the integrity of the system's perception of physical reality itself. This perception can be perilously manipulated by sophisticated attacks such as sensing eavesdropping, phantom dangers, and invisible threats, potentially resulting in direct and catastrophic physical harm. Traditionalsecuritymeasures, such as signature-based detection, are insufficient to counter these perception-level threats that mimic genuine physical signals. A proactive, layered, defense-in-depth strategy is required, integrating physical, environmental, intelligence, andarchitecturalsecuritymeasures to build a trustworthy ecosystem. Additionally, realizing ISAC's potential responsibly also depends on parallel efforts in global standardization and strong governance to address the significant challenges of privacy, liability, and the technology's dual-use.△ Less

Title   : A Demonstration of Self-Adaptive Jamming Attack Detection in AI/ML Integrated O-RAN

Abstract: The open radio access network (O-RAN) enables modular, intelligent, and programmable 5G networkarchitecturesthrough the adoption of software-defined networking, network function virtualization, and implementation of standardized open interfaces. However, one of thesecurityconcerns for O-RAN, which can severely undermine network performance, is jamming attacks.

The SAJD framework forms a closed-loop system that includes near-realtime inference of radio signal jamming via our developed ML-based xApp, as well as continuous monitoring and retraining pipelines through rApps. In this demonstration, we will show how SAJD outperforms state-of-the-art jamming detection xApp (offline trained with manual labels) in terms of accuracy and adaptability under various dynamic and previously unseen interference scenarios in the O-RAN-compliant testbed.△ Less

Title   : RA-Gen: A Controllable Code Generation Framework Using ReAct for Multi-Agent Task Execution
Source  : Submitted 9 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: Code generation models based on large language models (LLMs) have gained wide adoption, but challenges remain in ensuring safety, accuracy, and controllability, especially for complex tasks. Existing methods often lack dynamic integration of external tools, transparent reasoning, and user control over safety. To address these issues, we propose a controllable code generation framework utilizing the ReAct paradigm for multi-agent task execution. This framework is a multi-agent system designed to enable efficient, precise, and interpretable code generation through dynamic interactions between LLMs and external resources. The framework adopts a collaborativearchitecturecomprising four specialized agents: a Planner for task decomposition, a Searcher that leverages the ReAct framework for reasoning and tool integration, a CodeGen agent for accurate code generation, and an Extractor for structured data retrieval. The ReAct-based Searcher alternates between generating reasoning traces and executing actions, facilitating seamless integration of internal knowledge with external tools (such as search engines) to enhance accuracy and user control. Experimental results show the framework's effectiveness across multiple languages, achieving a 94.8%securityrate on the SVEN dataset with CodeQL, outperforming existing approaches. Its transparent reasoning process fosters user trust and improves controllability.△ Less

Title   : Defending MoE LLMs against Harmful Fine-Tuning via Safety Routing Alignment
Source  : Submitted 9 October, 2025; v1 submitted 26 September, 2025; originally announced September 2025.
Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have increasingly adopted the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)architecturefor efficiency. MoE-based LLMs heavily depend on a superficial safety mechanism in which harmful inputs are routed safety-critical experts. However, our analysis reveals that routing decisions for harmful inputs drift significantly after fine-tuning, exposing a critical vulnerability to harmful fine-tuning (HFT) attacks. Existing defenses, primarily designed for monolithic LLMs, are less effective for MoE LLMs as they fail to prevent drift in harmful input routing. To address this limitation, we propose SafeMoE, a safe fine-tuning method tailored to MoE LLMs. SafeMoE directly mitigates routing drift by penalizing the gap between the routing weights of a fine-tuned model and those of the initial safety-aligned model, thereby preserving the safety-aligned routing of harmful inputs to safety-critical experts. Experiments on open-source MoE LLMs ranging from 7B to 141B parameters demonstrate that SafeMoE effectively mitigates HFT attacks, reducing the harmfulness score of OLMoE from 62.0 to 5.0, for example, while maintaining task utility within 1% degradation and incurring only 2% overhead. It significantly outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods for safeguarding LLM fine-tuning and remains effective in recent large-scale MoE LLMs such as gpt-oss and Llama 4.

Title   : A Multimodal GUIArchitecturefor Interfacing with LLM-Based Conversational Assistants
Source  : Submitted 9 October, 2025; v1 submitted 31 August, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) and real-time speech recognition now make it possible to issue any graphical user interface (GUI) action through natural language and receive the corresponding system response directly through the GUI. Most production applications were never designed with speech in mind. This article provides a concretearchitecturethat enables GUIs to interface with LLM-based speech-enabled assistants.
  Thearchitecturemakes an application's navigation graph and semantics available through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The ViewModel, part of the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern, exposes the application's capabilities to the assistant by supplying both tools applicable to a currently visible view and application-global tools extracted from the GUI tree router. Thisarchitecturefacilitates full voice accessibility while ensuring reliable alignment between spoken input and the visual interface, accompanied by consistent feedback across modalities. It future-proofs apps for upcoming OS super assistants that employ computer use agents (CUAs) and natively consume MCP if an application provides it.
  To address concerns about privacy and datasecurity, the practical effectiveness of locally deployable, open-weight LLMs for speech-enabled multimodal UIs is evaluated. Findings suggest that recent smaller open-weight models approach the performance of leading proprietary models in overall accuracy and require enterprise-grade hardware for fast responsiveness.

Title   : Adaptive Quantum Homeopathy
Source  : Submitted 9 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: Randomness is a fundamental resource in quantum information, with crucial applications in cryptography, algorithms, and error correction. A central challenge is to construct unitary $k$-designs that closely approximate Haar-random unitaries while minimizing the costly use of non-Clifford operations. In this work, we present a protocol, named Quantum Homeopathy, able to generate unitary $k$-designs on $n$ qubits,secureagainst any adversarial quantum measurement, with a system-size-independent number of non-Clifford gates. Inspired by the principle of homeopathy, our method applies a $k$-design only to a subsystem of size $Θ(k)$, independent of $n$. This "seed" design is then "diluted" across the entire $n$-qubit system by sandwiching it between two random Clifford operators. The resulting ensemble forms an $\varepsilon$-approximate unitary $k$-design on $n$ qubits. We prove that this construction achieves full quantumsecurityagainst adaptive adversaries using only $\tilde{O}(k^2 \log\varepsilon^{-1})$ non-Clifford gates. If one requiressecurityonly against polynomial-time adaptive adversaries, the non-Clifford cost decreases to $\tilde{O}(k + \log^{1+c} \varepsilon^{-1})$. This is optimal, since we show that at least $Ω(k)$ non-Clifford gates are required in this setting. Compared to existing approaches, our method significantly reduces non-Clifford overhead while strengtheningsecurityguarantees to adaptivesecurityas well as removing artificial assumptions between $n$ and $k$. These results make high-order unitary designs practically attainable in near-term fault-tolerant quantumarchitectures.△ Less

Abstract: Cloud computing has become the foundation of modern digital infrastructure, yet the absence of a unifiedarchitecturaland compliance framework impedes interoperability, auditability, and robustsecurity.

We demonstrate its practical utility through OpenStack and AWS case studies, and provide reproducible validation workflows using SPARQL and SHACL.

Title   : Safe-Control: A Safety Patch for Mitigating Unsafe Content in Text-to-Image Generation Models
Source  : Submitted 9 October, 2025; v1 submitted 28 August, 2025; originally announced August 2025.
Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms, whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models. Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability, making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoisingarchitecture. We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models. Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generativearchitectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20% for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial attacks.△ Less

Abstract: Cooperative, Connected and Automated Mobility (CCAM) are complex cyber-physical systems (CPS) that integrate computation, communication, and control in safety-critical environments. At their core, System-on-Chip (SoC) platforms consolidate processing units, communication interfaces, AI accelerators, andsecuritymodules into a single chip.

However, in practice, this integrated SoC softwarearchitecturestill posessecuritychallenges, particularly in real-time, safety-critical environments. Recent reports highlight a surge in SoC-related vulnerabilities, yet systematic analysis of their root causes and impact within AUTOSAR-alignedarchitecturesis lacking. This study fills that gap by analyzing 180 publicly reported automotive SoC vulnerabilities, mapped to a representative SoC softwarearchitecturemodel that is aligned with AUTOSAR principles for layered abstraction and service orientation.

Source  : Submitted 8 October, 2025; v1 submitted 6 March, 2025; originally announced March 2025.
Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has given rise to four major application paradigms: LLM app stores, LLM agents, self-hosted LLM services, and LLM-powered devices. Each has its advantages but also shares common challenges. LLM app stores lower the barrier to development but lead to platform lock-in; LLM agents provide autonomy but lack a unified communication mechanism; self-hosted LLM services enhance control but increase deployment complexity; and LLM-powered devices improve privacy and real-time performance but are limited by hardware. This paper reviews and analyzes these paradigms, coveringarchitecturedesign, application ecosystem, research progress, as well as the challenges and open problems they face. Based on this, we outline the next frontier of LLM applications, characterizing them through three interconnected layers: infrastructure, protocol, and application. We describe their responsibilities and roles of each layer and demonstrate how to mitigate existing fragmentation limitations and improvesecurityand scalability. Finally, we discuss key future challenges, identify opportunities such as protocol-driven cross-platform collaboration and device integration, and propose a research roadmap for openness,security, and sustainability.△ Less

Abstract: This paper presents Ryt AI, an LLM-native agentic framework that powers Ryt Bank to enable customers to execute core financial transactions through natural language conversation. This represents the first global regulator-approved deployment worldwide where conversational AI functions as the primary banking interface, in contrast to prior assistants that have been limited to advisory or support roles. Built entirely in-house, Ryt AI is powered by ILMU, a closed-source LLM developed internally, and replaces rigid multi-screen workflows with a single dialogue orchestrated by four LLM-powered agents (Guardrails, Intent, Payment, and FAQ). Each agent attaches a task-specific LoRA adapter to ILMU, which is hosted within the bank's infrastructure to ensure consistent behavior with minimal overhead. Deterministic guardrails, human-in-the-loop confirmation, and a stateless auditarchitectureprovide defense-in-depth forsecurityand compliance.

Title   : Cocoon: A SystemArchitecturefor Differentially Private Training with Correlated Noises
Source  : Submitted 8 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models memorize and leak training data, causing serious privacy issues to data owners. Training algorithms with differential privacy (DP), such as DP-SGD, have been gaining attention as a solution. However, DP-SGD adds a noise at each training iteration, which degrades the accuracy of the trained model. To improve accuracy, a new family of approaches adds carefully designed correlated noises, so that noises cancel out each other across iterations. We performed an extensive characterization study of these new mechanisms, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, and show they incur non-negligible overheads when the model is large or uses large embedding tables. Motivated by the analysis, we propose Cocoon, a hardware-software co-designed framework for efficient training with correlated noises. Cocoon accelerates models with embedding tables through pre-computing and storing correlated noises in a coalesced format (Cocoon-Emb), and supports large models through a custom near-memory processing device (Cocoon-NMP). On a real system with an FPGA-based NMP device prototype, Cocoon improves the performance by 2.33-10.82x(Cocoon-Emb) and 1.55-3.06x (Cocoon-NMP).△ Less

Abstract: Current generative steganography research mainly pursues computationally expensive mappings to perfect Gaussian priors within single diffusion modelarchitectures. This work introduces an efficient framework based on approximate Gaussian mapping governed by a scale factor calibrated through capacity-aware adaptive optimization. Using this framework as a unified analytical tool, systematic comparative analysis of steganography in pixel-space models versus VAE-based latent-space systems is conducted. The investigation reveals a pronouncedarchitecturedependentsecurity-robustness trade-off: pixel-space models achieve highsecurityagainst steganalysis but exhibit fragility to channel distortions, while VAE-based systems like Stable Diffusion offer substantial robustness at the cost ofsecurityvulnerabilities. Further analysis indicates that the VAE component drives this behavior through opposing mechanisms where the encoder confers robustness via manifold regularization while the decoder introduces vulnerabilities by amplifying latent perturbations into detectable artifacts. These findings characterize the conflictingarchitecturalroles in generative steganography and establish a foundation for future research.△ Less

Abstract: Pingmark defines a universal textual protocol for expressing spatial context through a minimal symbol: !@. Rather than embedding coordinates or using proprietary map links, Pingmark introduces a semantic trigger that compliant client applications interpret to generate a standardized resolver link of the form https://pingmark.me/lat/lon/[timestamp]. This allows location expression to function like existing textual conventions - @ for identity or # for topics - but for physical space. The protocol requires no user registration, relies on open mapping technologies, and protects privacy by generating location data ephemerally and locally. This paper presents the motivation, syntax, and design of the Pingmark Protocol Specification (PPS v0.1), its reference resolver implementation, and the long-term goal of establishing Pingmark as an open Internet standard for spatial mentions.△ Less

Abstract: Industrial control system (ICS) operations use trusted endpoints like human machine interfaces (HMIs) and workstations to relay commands to programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Because most PLCs lack layered defenses, compromise of a trusted endpoint can drive unsafe actuator commands and risk safety-critical operation. This research presents an embedded intrusion detection system that runs inside the controller and uses header-level telemetry to detect and respond to network attacks. The system combines a semi-supervised anomaly detector and a supervised attack classifier. We evaluate the approach on a midstream oil-terminal testbed using three datasets collected during tanker-truck loading. The anomaly detector achieves zero missed attacks, corresponding to 0.998 Matthews correlation. The supervised stage attains 97.37 percent hold-out accuracy and 97.03 percent external accuracy. The embedded design adds a median of 2,031 microseconds of end-to-end latency and does not impact PLC's cycle time.

Title   : GNN-enhanced Traffic Anomaly Detection for Next-Generation SDN-Enabled Consumer Electronics
Source  : Submitted 8 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: Consumer electronics (CE) connected to the Internet of Things are susceptible to various attacks, including DDoS and web-based threats, which can compromise their functionality and facilitate remote hijacking. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to exploit CE for broader system attacks while enabling the propagation of malicious code across the CE network, resulting in device failures. Existing deep learning-based traffic anomaly detection systems exhibit high accuracy in traditional network environments but are often overly complex and reliant on static infrastructure, necessitating manual configuration and management. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable network model that integrates Software-defined Networking (SDN) and Compute First Networking (CFN) for next-generation CE networks. In this network model, we propose a Graph Neural Networks-based Network Anomaly Detection framework (GNN-NAD) that integrates SDN-based CE networks and enables the CFNarchitecture. GNN-NAD uniquely fuses a static, vulnerability-aware attack graph with dynamic traffic features, providing a holistic view of networksecurity. The core of the framework is a GNN model (GSAGE) for graph representation learning, followed by a Random Forest (RF) classifier. This design (GSAGE+RF) demonstrates superior performance compared to existing feature selection methods. Experimental evaluations on CE environment reveal that GNN-NAD achieves superior metrics in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score, even with small sample sizes, exceeding the performance of current network anomaly detection methods. This work advances thesecurityand efficiency of next-generation intelligent CE networks.△ Less

Title   : RevealNet: Distributed Traffic Correlation for Attack Attribution on Programmable Networks
Source  : Submitted 8 October, 2025; v1 submitted 1 May, 2025; originally announced May 2025.
Abstract: Network attackers have increasingly resorted to proxy chains, VPNs, and anonymity networks to conceal their activities. To tackle this issue, past research has explored the applicability of traffic correlation techniques to perform attack attribution, i.e., to identify an attacker's true network location. However, current traffic correlation approaches rely on well-provisioned and centralized systems that ingest flows from multiple network probes to compute correlation scores. Unfortunately, this makes correlation efforts scale poorly for large high-speed networks.
  In this paper, we propose RevealNet, a decentralized framework for attack attribution that orchestrates a fleet of P4-programmable switches to perform traffic correlation. RevealNet builds on a set of correlation primitives inspired by prior work on computing and comparing flow sketches -- compact summaries of flows' key characteristics -- to enable efficient, distributed, in-network traffic correlation. Our evaluation suggests that RevealNet achieves comparable accuracy to centralized attack attribution systems while significantly reducing both the computational complexity and bandwidth overheads imposed by correlation tasks.△ Less

Abstract: GraphQL's flexibility, while beneficial for efficient data fetching, introduces uniquesecurityvulnerabilities that traditional APIsecuritymechanisms often fail to address. Malicious GraphQL queries can exploit the language's dynamic nature, leading to denial-of-service attacks, data exfiltration through injection, and other exploits. Existing solutions, such as static analysis, rate limiting, and general-purpose Web Application Firewalls, offer limited protection against sophisticated, context-aware attacks. This paper presents a novel, AI-driven approach for real-time detection of malicious GraphQL queries. Our method combines static analysis with machine learning techniques, including Large Language Models (LLMs) for dynamic schema-based configuration, Sentence Transformers (SBERT and Doc2Vec) for contextual embedding of query payloads, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Random Forests, and Multilayer Perceptrons for classification. We detail the systemarchitecture, implementation strategies optimized for production environments (including ONNX Runtime optimization and parallel processing), and evaluate the performance of our detection models and the overall system under load. Results demonstrate high accuracy in detecting various threats, including SQL injection, OS command injection, and XSS exploits, alongside effective mitigation of DoS and SSRF attempts.

Abstract: The unique optical properties of quantum dots (QDs), size-tunable emission and high quantum yield, make them ideal candidates for applications insecurequantum communication, quantum computing, targeted single-cell and molecular tagging, and sensing. Scalable and deterministic heterointegration strategies for single QDs have, however, remained largely out of reach due to inherent material incompatibilities with conventional semiconductor manufacturing processes. To advance scalable photonic quantum devicearchitectures, it is therefore crucial to adopt placement and heterointegration strategies that can address these challenges. Here, we present an electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing model, single particle extraction electrodynamics (SPEED) printing, that exploits a novel regime of nanoscale dielectrophoretics to print and deterministically position single colloidal QDs. Using QDs solubilized in apolar solvents, this additive, zero-waste nanomanufacturing process overcomes continuum fluid surface energetics and stochastic imprecision that limited previous colloidal deposition strategies, achieving selective extraction and deposition of individual QDs at sub-zeptoliter volumes. Photoluminescence and autocorrelation function (g(2)) measurements confirm nanophotonic cavity-QD integration and single-photon emission from single printed QDs. By enabling deterministic placement of single quantum dots, this method provides a powerful, scalable, and sustainable platform for integrating complex photonic circuits and quantum light sources with nanoscale precision.△ Less

Title   : From Description to Detection: LLM based Extendable O-RAN Compliant Blind DoS Detection in 5G and Beyond
Source  : Submitted 7 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: The quality and experience of mobile communication have significantly improved with the introduction of 5G, and these improvements are expected to continue beyond the 5G era. However, vulnerabilities in control-plane protocols, such as Radio Resource Control (RRC) and Non-Access Stratum (NAS), pose significantsecuritythreats, such as Blind Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Despite the availability of existing anomaly detection methods that leverage rule-based systems or traditional machine learning methods, these methods have several limitations, including the need for extensive training data, predefined rules, and limited explainability. Addressing these challenges, we propose a novel anomaly detection framework that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in zero-shot mode with unordered data and short natural language attack descriptions within the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN)architecture. We analyse robustness to prompt variation, demonstrate the practicality of automating the attack descriptions and show that detection quality relies on the semantic completeness of the description rather than its phrasing or length. We utilise an RRC/NAS dataset to evaluate the solution and provide an extensive comparison of open-source and proprietary LLM implementations to demonstrate superior performance in attack detection. We further validate the practicality of our framework within O-RAN's real-time constraints, illustrating its potential for detecting other Layer-3 attacks.△ Less

Abstract: The rapid shift from passive LLMs to autonomous LLM-agents marks a new paradigm in cybersecurity. While these agents can act as powerful tools for both offensive and defensive operations, the very agentic context introduces a new class of inherentsecurityrisks. In this work we present the first holistic survey of the agenticsecuritylandscape, structuring the field around three interdependent pillars: Applications, Threats, and Defenses. We provide a comprehensive taxonomy of over 150 papers, explaining how agents are used, the vulnerabilities they possess, and the countermeasures designed to protect them.

Title   : Blind quantum computing with different qudit resource statearchitectures
Source  : Submitted 7 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: We discuss how blind quantum computing generalizes to multi-level quantum systems (qudits), which offers advantages compared to the qubit approach. Here, a quantum computing task is delegated to an untrusted server while simultaneously preventing the server from retrieving information about the computation it performs, the input, and the output, enablingsecurecloud-based quantum computing. In the standard approach with qubits, measurement-based quantum computing is used: single-qubit measurements on cluster or brickwork states implement the computation, while random rotations of the resource qubits hide the computation from the server. We generalize finite-sized approximately universal gate sets to prime-power-dimensional qudits and show that qudit versions of the cluster and brickwork states enable a similar server-blind execution of quantum algorithms. Furthermore, we compare the overheads of different resource statearchitecturesand discuss which hiding strategies apply to alternative qudit resource states beyond graph states.△ Less

Title   : Extending ResourceLink: Patterns for Large Dataset Processing in MCP Applications
Source  : Submitted 7 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: Large language models translate natural language into database queries, yet context window limitations prevent direct deployment in reporting systems where complete datasets exhaust available tokens. The Model Context Protocol specification defines ResourceLink for referencing external resources, but practical patterns for implementing scalable reportingarchitecturesremain undocumented. This paper presents patterns for building LLM-powered reporting systems that decouple query generation from data retrieval. We introduce a dual-response pattern extending ResourceLink to support both iterative query refinement and out-of-band data access, accompanied by patterns for multi-tenantsecurityand resource lifecycle management. These patterns address fundamental challenges in LLM-driven reporting applications and provide practical guidance for developers building them.△ Less

Title   : AdProv: A Method for Provenance of Process Adaptations
Source  : Submitted 7 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: Provenance in scientific workflows is essential for understand- ing and reproducing processes, while in business processes, it can ensure compliance and correctness and facilitates process mining. However, the provenance of process adaptations, especially modifications during execu- tion, remains insufficiently addressed. A review of the literature reveals a lack of systematic approaches for capturing provenance information about adaptive workflows/processes. To fill this gap, we propose the AdProv method for collecting, storing, retrieving, and visualizing prove- nance of runtime workflow adaptations. In addition to the definition of the AdProv method in terms of steps and concepts like change events, we also present anarchitecturefor a Provenance Holder service that is essential for implementing the method. To ensure semantic consistency and interoperability we define a mapping to the ontology PROV Ontol- ogy (PROV-O). Additionally, we extend the XES standard with elements for adaptation logging. Our main contributions are the AdProv method and a comprehensive framework and its tool support for managing adap- tive workflow provenance, facilitating advanced provenance tracking and analysis for different application domains.△ Less

Title   : MadNCL: A GPU Implementation of Algorithm NCL for Large-Scale, Degenerate Nonlinear Programs
Source  : Submitted 7 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: We present a GPU implementation of Algorithm NCL, an augmented Lagrangian method for solving large-scale and degenerate nonlinear programs. Although interior-point methods and sequential quadratic programming are widely used for solving nonlinear programs, the augmented Lagrangian method is known to offer superior robustness against constraint degeneracies and can rapidly detect infeasibility. We introduce several enhancements to Algorithm NCL, including fusion of the inner and outer loops and use of extrapolation steps, which improve both efficiency and convergence stability. Further, NCL has the key advantage of being well-suited for GPUarchitecturesbecause of the regularity of the KKT systems provided by quadratic penalty terms. In particular, the NCL subproblem formulation allows the KKT systems to be naturally expressed as either stabilized or condensed KKT systems, whereas the interior-point approach requires aggressive reformulations or relaxations to make it suitable for GPUs. Both systems can be efficiently solved on GPUs using sparse \ldlt factorization with static pivoting, as implemented in NVIDIA cuDSS. Building on these advantages, we examine the KKT systems arising from NCL subproblems. We present an optimized GPU implementation of Algorithm NCL by leveraging MadNLP as an interior-point subproblem solver and utilizing the stabilized and condensed formulations of the KKT systems for computing Newton steps. Numerical experiments on various large-scale and degenerate NLPs, including optimal power flow, COPS benchmarks, andsecurity-constrained optimal power flow, demonstrate that MadNCL operates efficiently on GPUs while effectively managing problem degeneracy, including MPCC constraints.△ Less

Title   : Efficient MPC-Based Energy Management System forSecureand Cost-Effective Microgrid Operations
Source  : Submitted 7 October, 2025; v1 submitted 23 September, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC)-based energy management systems (EMS) are essential for ensuring optimal,secure, and stable operation in microgrids with high penetrations of distributed energy resources. However, due to the high computational cost for the decision-making, the conventional MPC-based EMS typically adopts a simplified integrated-bus power balance model. While this simplification is effective for small networks, large-scale systems require a more detailed branch flow model to account for the increased impact of grid power losses andsecurityconstraints. This work proposes an efficient and reliable MPC-based EMS that incorporates power-loss effects and grid-securityconstraints. %, while adaptively shaping the battery power profile in response to online renewable inputs, achieving reduced operational costs. It enhances system reliability, reduces operational costs, and shows strong potential for online implementation due to its reduced computational effort. Specifically, a second-order cone program (SOCP) branch flow relaxation is integrated into the constraint set, yielding a convex formulation that guarantees globally optimal solutions with high computational efficiency. Owing to the radial topology of the microgrid, this relaxation is practically tight, ensuring equivalence to the original problem. Building on this foundation, an online demand response (DR) module is designed to further reduce the operation cost through peak shaving. To the best of our knowledge, no prior MPC-EMS framework has simultaneously modeled losses andsecurityconstraints while coordinating flexible loads within a unifiedarchitecture. The developed framework enablessecureoperation with effective peak shaving and reduced total cost. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on 10-bus, 18-bus, and 33-bus systems.△ Less

Title   : Signing Right Away
Source  : Submitted 7 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: The proliferation of high-fidelity synthetic media, coupled with exploitable hardware vulnerabilities in conventional imaging pipelines, has precipitated a crisis of trust in digital content. Existing countermeasures, from post-hoc classifiers to software-based signing, fail to address the fundamental challenge of establishing an unbreakable link to reality at the moment of capture. This whitepaper introduces Signing Right Away (SRA), a comprehensivesecurityarchitecturethat guarantees the provenance of digital media from "silicon to silicon to signed file." SRA leverages a four-pillarsecuritymodel-Confidentiality, Integrity, Authentication, and Replay Protection, akin to the MIPI CameraSecurityFramework (CSF), but also extends its scope beyond the internal data bus to the creation of a cryptographically sealed, C2PA-compliant final asset. Bysecuringthe entire imaging pipeline within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), SRA ensures that every captured image and video carries an immutable, verifiable proof of origin. This provides a foundational solution for industries reliant on trustworthy visual information, including journalism, legal evidence, and insurance. We present the SRAarchitecture, a detailed implementation roadmap informed by empirical prototyping, and a comparative analysis that positions SRA as the essential "last mile" in the chain of content trust.△ Less

Title   : Towards Reliable and Practical LLMSecurityEvaluations via Bayesian Modelling
Source  : Submitted 7 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: Before adopting a new large language model (LLM)architecture, it is critical to understand vulnerabilities accurately. Existing evaluations can be difficult to trust, often drawing conclusions from LLMs that are not meaningfully comparable, relying on heuristic inputs or employing metrics that fail to capture the inherent uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a principled and practical end-to-end framework for evaluating LLM vulnerabilities to prompt injection attacks. First, we propose practical approaches to experimental design, tackling unfair LLM comparisons by considering two practitioner scenarios: when training an LLM and when deploying a pre-trained LLM. Second, we address the analysis of experiments and propose a Bayesian hierarchical model with embedding-space clustering. This model is designed to improve uncertainty quantification in the common scenario that LLM outputs are not deterministic, test prompts are designed imperfectly, and practitioners only have a limited amount of compute to evaluate vulnerabilities. We show the improved inferential capabilities of the model in several prompt injection attack settings. Finally, we demonstrate the pipeline to evaluate thesecurityof Transformer versus Mambaarchitectures. Our findings show that consideration of output variability can suggest less definitive findings. However, for some attacks, we find notably increased Transformer and Mamba-variant vulnerabilities across LLMs with the same training data or mathematical ability.△ Less

Title   : Model Context Protocol (MCP): Landscape,SecurityThreats, and Future Research Directions
Source  : Submitted 7 October, 2025; v1 submitted 29 March, 2025; originally announced March 2025.
Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an emerging open standard that defines a unified, bi-directional communication and dynamic discovery protocol between AI models and external tools or resources, aiming to enhance interoperability and reduce fragmentation across diverse systems. This paper presents a systematic study of MCP from botharchitecturalandsecurityperspectives. We first define the full lifecycle of an MCP server, comprising four phases (creation, deployment, operation, and maintenance), further decomposed into 16 key activities that capture its functional evolution. Building on this lifecycle analysis, we construct a comprehensive threat taxonomy that categorizessecurityand privacy risks across four major attacker types: malicious developers, external attackers, malicious users, andsecurityflaws, encompassing 16 distinct threat scenarios. To validate these risks, we develop and analyze real-world case studies that demonstrate concrete attack surfaces and vulnerability manifestations within MCP implementations. Based on these findings, the paper proposes a set of fine-grained, actionablesecuritysafeguards tailored to each lifecycle phase and threat category, offering practical guidance forsecureMCP adoption. We also analyze the current MCP landscape, covering industry adoption, integration patterns, and supporting tools, to identify its technological strengths as well as existing limitations that constrain broader deployment. Finally, we outline future research and development directions aimed at strengthening MCP's standardization, trust boundaries, and sustainable growth within the evolving ecosystem of tool-augmented AI systems.△ Less

Abstract: AI-based solutions demonstrate remarkable results in identifying vulnerabilities in software, but research has consistently found that this performance does not generalize to unseen codebases. In this paper, we specifically investigate the impact of modelarchitecture, parameter configuration, and quality of training data on the ability of these systems to generalize.
  For this purpose, we introduce VulGate, a high quality state of the art dataset that mitigates the shortcomings of prior datasets, by removing mislabeled and duplicate samples, updating new vulnerabilities, incorporating additional metadata, integrating hard samples, and including dedicated test sets. We undertake a series of experiments to demonstrate that improved dataset diversity and quality substantially enhances vulnerability detection. We also introduce and benchmark multiple encoder-only and decoder-only models. We find that encoder-based models outperform other models in terms of accuracy and generalization. Our model achieves \textbf{6.8\%} improvement in recall on the benchmark BigVul dataset and outperforms others on unseen projects, demonstrating enhanced generalizability. Our results highlight the role of data quality and model selection in the development of robust vulnerability detection systems. Our findings suggest a direction for future systems with high cross-project effectiveness.△ Less

Title   : Multi-Agent Distributed Optimization With Feasible Set Privacy
Source  : Submitted 6 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: We consider the problem of decentralized constrained optimization with multiple agents $E_1,\ldots,E_N$ who jointly wish to learn the optimal solution set while keeping their feasible sets $\mathcal{P}_1,\ldots,\mathcal{P}_N$ private from each other. We assume that the objective function $f$ is known to all agents and each feasible set is a collection of points from a universal alphabet $\mathcal{P}_{alph}$. A designated agent (leader) starts the communication with the remaining (non-leader) agents, and is the first to retrieve the solution set. The leader searches for the solution by sending queries to and receiving answers from the non-leaders, such that the information on the individual feasible sets revealed to the leader should be no more than nominal, i.e., what is revealed from learning the solution set alone. We develop achievable schemes for obtaining the solution set at nominal information leakage, and characterize their communication costs under two communication setups between agents. In this work, we focus on two kinds of network setups: i) ring, where each agent communicates with two adjacent agents, and ii) star, where only the leader communicates with the remaining agents. We show that, if the leader first learns the joint feasible set through an existing private set intersection (PSI) protocol and then deduces the solution set, the information leaked to the leader is greater than nominal. Moreover, we draw connection of our schemes to threshold PSI (ThPSI), which is a PSI-variant where the intersection is revealed only when its cardinality is larger than a threshold value. Finally, for various realizations of $f$ mapped uniformly at random to a fixed range of values, our schemes are more communication-efficient with a high probability compared to retrieving the entire feasible set through PSI.△ Less

Title   : Assessing the Viability of Quantum-Resistant IKEv2 over Constrained and Internet-Scale Networks
Source  : Submitted 6 October, 2025; v1 submitted 24 November, 2024; originally announced November 2024.
Abstract: Within 1-2 decades, quantum computers may become powerful enough to break current public-key cryptography, prompting authorities such as the IETF and NIST to push for adopting quantum-resistant cryptography (QRC) in ecosystems like Internet ProtocolSecurity(IPsec). Yet, IPsec struggles to adopt QRC, primarily because Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2), which sets up IPsec sessions, cannot easily tolerate the large public keys and digital signatures of QRC. Many IETF RFCs have been proposed to integrate QRC into IKEv2, but their performance and interplay remain largely untested in practice. In this paper, we measure the performance of these RFCs over constrained links by developing a flexible, reproducible measurement testbed for IPsec with quantum-resistant IKEv2 proposals. Deploying our testbed in lossy wireless links and on the internationally distributed FABRIC testbed for Internet scenarios, we reveal that bottlenecks arise with quantum-resistant IKEv2 under high round-trip times, non-trivial packet loss, or other constraints. Our results, including the revelation of a 400-1000-fold increase in data overhead over high-loss wireless links, expose the shortcomings of today's RFCs and call for further work in this vital area of post-quantum networksecurity.△ Less

Title   : High vs. Low AGI: Ontology and Conceptual Taxonomy for Geopolitical Coherence
Source  : Submitted 6 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: The rapid progression of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research demands conceptual tools capable of distinguishing between systems developed for open, commercial integration and those destined for sovereign, securitized deployments. Without such distinctions, risk assessments and regulatory debates collapse AGI into legacy dual-use frameworks that are ill-suited for these resources, capturing the possibility of civilian and military application but overlooking the distinct societal lineages yielded by corporate and state-gradearchitectures. This paper proposes a taxonomy distinguishing low-AGI and high-AGI, clarifying how commercial-economic andsecurity-sovereignarchitecturescan be distinguished not only by function, but by the social and political ecosystems that produce them. The taxonomy builds on international relations concepts of "high/low politics," viewed through the lens of construal-level theory, which allows it to even capture how cooperation and conflict may coexist in the context of AGI's emerging geopolitical stakes. By embedding AGI within power structures and securitization theory, this contribution extends dual-use discourse through an ontological taxonomy that enables more granular risk assessment and governance design--equipping policymakers and researchers to anticipatesecuritydilemmas, institutional demands, and technical-political spillovers in the international system.△ Less

Title   : Impossible Cloud Network: A Decentralized Internet Infrastructure Layer
Source  : Submitted 6 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: The internet faces a sovereignty crisis due to power concentration and data growth among a few hyperscalers, leading to centralization and loss of user control. This consolidation risks censorship and creates single points of failure. While Web3 offers decentralized solutions, they often sacrifice either scalability, decentralization, orsecurity, which are key elements in the blockchain trilemma. These solutions also struggle with limited access to enterprise-grade hardware and frequently rely on centralized infrastructure. The Impossible Cloud Network (ICN) addresses these issues by creating a multi-tiered, decentralized infrastructure layer. ICN offers a composable service layer, an enterprise-grade hardware resource layer, and a transparent, permissionless HyperNode network for performance enforcement. By strategically decoupling and decentralizing each layer, ICN aims to provide an open, extensively scalable infrastructure that ensures digital sovereignty, eliminates single points of trust, enables service programmability, and offers a decoupledarchitecturefor limitless possibilities in the future internet.△ Less

Title   : PoS-CoPOR: Proof-of-Stake Consensus Protocol with Native Onion Routing Providing Scalability and DoS-Resistance
Source  : Submitted 6 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus protocols often face a trade-off between performance andsecurity. Protocols that pre-elect leaders for subsequent rounds are vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, which can disrupt the network and compromise liveness. In this work, we present PoS-CoPOR, a single-chain PoS consensus protocol that mitigates this vulnerability by integrating a native onion routing mechanism into the consensus protocol itself. PoS-CoPOR combines stake-weighted probabilistic leader election with an anonymization layer that conceals the network identity of the next block proposer. This approach prevents targeted DoS attacks on leaders before they produce a block, thus enhancing network resilience. We implemented and evaluated PoS-CoPOR, demonstrating its ability to achieve a throughput of up to 110 tx/s with 6 nodes, even with the overhead of the anonymization layer. The results show that native anonymization can provide robust DoS resistance with only a modest impact on performance, offering a solution to buildsecureand scalable PoS blockchains.△ Less

Source  : Submitted 4 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: The widespread adoption of Machine Learning as a Service raises critical privacy andsecurityconcerns, particularly about data confidentiality and trust in both cloud providers and the machine learning models. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) has emerged as a promising solution to this problems, allowing computations on encrypted data without decryption. Despite its potential, existing approaches to integrate HE into neural networks are often limited to specificarchitectures, leaving a wide gap in providing a framework for easy development of HE-friendly privacy-preserving neural network models similar to what we have in the broader field of machine learning. In this paper, we present FHEON, a configurable framework for developing privacy-preserving convolutional neural network (CNN) models for inference using HE. FHEON introduces optimized and configurable implementations of privacy-preserving CNN layers including convolutional layers, average pooling layers, ReLU activation functions, and fully connected layers. These layers are configured using parameters like input channels, output channels, kernel size, stride, and padding to support arbitrary CNNarchitectures. We assess the performance of FHEON using several CNNarchitectures, including LeNet-5, VGG-11, VGG- 16, ResNet-20, and ResNet-34. FHEON maintains encrypted-domain accuracies within +/- 1% of their plaintext counterparts for ResNet-20 and LeNet-5 models. Notably, on a consumer-grade CPU, the models build on FHEON achieved 98.5% accuracy with a latency of 13 seconds on MNIST using LeNet-5, and 92.2% accuracy with a latency of 403 seconds on CIFAR-10 using ResNet-20.

Title   : PrivSpike: Employing Homomorphic Encryption for Private Inference of Deep Spiking Neural Networks
Source  : Submitted 4 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: Deep learning has become a cornerstone of modern machine learning. It relies heavily on vast datasets and significant computational resources for high performance. This data often contains sensitive information, making privacy a major concern in deep learning. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient alternative to conventional deep learning approaches. Nevertheless, SNNs still depend on large volumes of data, inheriting all the privacy challenges of deep learning. Homomorphic encryption addresses this challenge by allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data, ensuring data confidentiality throughout the entire processing pipeline. In this paper, we introduce PRIVSPIKE, a privacy-preserving inference framework for SNNs using the CKKS homomorphic encryption scheme. PRIVSPIKE supports arbitrary depth SNNs and introduces two key algorithms for evaluating the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire activation function: (1) a polynomial approximation algorithm designed for high-performance SNN inference, and (2) a novel scheme-switching algorithm that optimizes precision at a higher computational cost. We evaluate PRIVSPIKE on MNIST, CIFAR-10, Neuromorphic MNIST, and CIFAR-10 DVS using models from LeNet-5 and ResNet-19architectures, achieving encrypted inference accuracies of 98.10%, 79.3%, 98.1%, and 66.0%, respectively. On a consumer-grade CPU, SNN LeNet-5 models achieved inference times of 28 seconds on MNIST and 212 seconds on Neuromorphic MNIST. For SNN ResNet-19 models, inference took 784 seconds on CIFAR-10 and 1846 seconds on CIFAR-10 DVS. These results establish PRIVSPIKE as a viable and efficient solution forsecureSNN inference, bridging the gap between energy-efficient deep neural networks and strong cryptographic privacy guarantees while outperforming prior encrypted SNN solutions.△ Less

Title   : Multi-Agent Code-Orchestrated Generation for Reliable Infrastructure-as-Code
Source  : Submitted 4 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: The increasing complexity of cloud-native infrastructure has made Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) essential for reproducible and scalable deployments. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating IaC snippets from natural language prompts, their monolithic, single-pass generation approach often results in syntactic errors, policy violations, and unscalable designs. In this paper, we propose MACOG (Multi-Agent Code-Orchestrated Generation), a novel multi-agent LLM-basedarchitecturefor IaC generation that decomposes the task into modular subtasks handled by specialized agents: Architect, Provider Harmonizer, Engineer, Reviewer,SecurityProver, Cost and Capacity Planner, DevOps, and Memory Curator. The agents interact via a shared-blackboard, finite-state orchestrator layer, and collectively produce Terraform configurations that are not only syntactically valid but also policy-compliant and semantically coherent. To ensure infrastructure correctness and governance, we incorporate Terraform Plan for execution validation and Open Policy Agent (OPA) for customizable policy enforcement. We evaluate MACOG using the IaC-Eval benchmark, where MACOG is the top enhancement across models, e.g., GPT-5 improves from 54.90 (RAG) to 74.02 and Gemini-2.5 Pro from 43.56 to 60.13, with concurrent gains on BLEU, CodeBERTScore, and an LLM-judge metric. Ablations show constrained decoding and deploy feedback are critical: removing them drops IaC-Eval to 64.89 and 56.93, respectively.△ Less

Source  : Submitted 4 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: In this paper, sensing-assistedsecurecommunication in a multi-user multi-eavesdropper integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system is investigated. Confidential communication signals and dedicated sensing signals are jointly transmitted by a base station (BS) to simultaneously serve users and sense aerial eavesdroppers (AEs). A sum rate maximization problem is formulated under AEs' Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) and sensing Signal-to-Clutter-plus-Noise Ratio (SCNR) constraints. A fractional-programming-based alternating optimization algorithm is developed to solve this problem for fully digital arrays, where successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) are leveraged to handle non-convex constraints. Furthermore, the minimum number of dedicated sensing beams is analyzed via a worst-case rank bound, upon which the proposed beamforming design is further extended to the hybrid analog-digital (HAD) arrayarchitecture, where the unit-modulus constraint is addressed by manifold optimization. Simulation results demonstrate that only a small number of sensing beams are sufficient for both sensing and jamming AEs, and the proposed designs consistently outperform strong baselines while also revealing the communication-sensing trade-off.△ Less

Abstract: While reinforcement learning-trained Large Reasoning Models (LRMs, e.g., Deepseek-R1) demonstrate advanced reasoning capabilities in the evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) domain, their susceptibility tosecuritythreats remains a critical vulnerability. This weakness is particularly evident in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation processes, where adversarial methods like backdoor prompt attacks can systematically subvert the model's core reasoning mechanisms. The emerging Chain-of-Thought Attack (CoTA) reveals this vulnerability through exploiting prompt controllability, simultaneously degrading both CoT safety and task performance with low-cost interventions. To address this compoundedsecurity-performance vulnerability, we propose Thought Purity (TP): a defense framework that systematically strengthens resistance to malicious content while preserving operational efficacy. Our solution achieves this through three synergistic components: (1) a safety-optimized data processing pipeline (2) reinforcement learning-enhanced rule constraints (3) adaptive monitoring metrics. Our approach establishes the first comprehensive defense mechanism against CoTA vulnerabilities in reinforcement learning-aligned reasoning systems, significantly advancing thesecurity-functionality equilibrium for next-generation AIarchitectures.△ Less

While initial agentic approaches employed a monolithicarchitecture, the Model-Context-Protocol has now enabled a remote-procedure call (RPC) paradigm to agentic applications, allowing for the flexible construction and composition of multi-function agents. This paper describes PentestMCP, a library of MCP server implementations that support agentic penetration testing. By supporting common penetration testing tasks such as network scanning, resource enumeration, service fingerprinting, vulnerability scanning, exploitation, and post-exploitation, PentestMCP allows a developer to customize multi-agent workflows for performing penetration tests.△ Less

Title   : LLM Agents for Automated Dependency Upgrades
Source  : Submitted 3 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: As a codebase expands over time, its library dependencies can become outdated and require updates to maintain innovation andsecurity. However, updating a library can introduce breaking changes in the code, necessitating significant developer time for maintenance. To address this, we introduce a framework of LLM agents to be used in combination with migration documentation to automatically recommend and apply code updates and ensure compatibility with new versions. Our solution can automatically localize updated library usages in live Java codebases and implement recommended fixes in a user-friendly manner. The systemarchitectureconsists of multiple key components: a Summary Agent, Control Agent, and Code Agent. To validate our approach, we apply the framework on an industrial use case by which we create three synthetic code repositories with major Upgrade changes and benchmark our approach against state-of-the-art methods. Results show that our approach not only performs upgrades using fewer tokens across all cases but also achieves a precision of 71.4%, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods.△ Less

Title   : SecurityAnalysis and Threat Modeling of Research Management Applications [Extended Version]
Source  : Submitted 3 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: Research management applications (RMA) are widely used in clinical research environments to collect, transmit, analyze, and store sensitive data. This data is so valuable making RMAs susceptible tosecuritythreats. This analysis, analyzes RMAs'security, focusing on Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) as an example. We explore the strengths and vulnerabilities within RMAs by evaluating thearchitecture, data flow, andsecurityfeatures. We identify and assess potential risks using the MITRE ATT\&CK framework and STRIDE model. We assess REDCap's defenses against common attack vectors focusing onsecurityto provide confidentiality, integrity, availability, non-repudiation, and authentication. We conclude by proposing recommendations for enhancing thesecurityof RMAs, ensuring that critical research data remains protected without compromising usability. This research aims to contribute towards a moresecureframework for managing sensitive information in research-intensive environments.△ Less

Title   : TPM-Based Continuous Remote Attestation and Integrity Verification for 5G VNFs on Kubernetes
Source  : Submitted 3 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of 5G technology, the adoption of cloud-based infrastructure for the deployment of 5G services has become increasingly common. Using a service-basedarchitecture, critical 5G components, such as the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF), Session Management Function (SMF), and User Plane Function (UPF), now run as containerized pods on Kubernetes clusters. Although this approach improves scalability, flexibility, and resilience, it also introduces newsecuritychallenges, particularly to ensure the integrity and trustworthiness of these components. Current 5Gsecurityspecifications (for example, 3GPP TS 33.501) focus on communicationsecurityand assume that network functions remain trustworthy after authentication, consequently lacking mechanisms to continuously validate the integrity of NVFs at runtime. To close this gap, and to align with Zero Trust principles of 'never trust, always verify', we present a TPM 2.0-based continuous remote attestation solution for core 5G components deployed on Kubernetes. Our approach uses the Linux Integrity MeasurementArchitecture(IMA) and a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to provide hardware-based runtime validation. We integrate the open-source Keylime framework with a custom IMA template that isolates pod-level measurements, allowing per-pod integrity verification. A prototype on a k3s cluster (consisting of 1 master, 2 worker nodes) was implemented to attest to core functions, including AMF, SMF and UPF. The experimental results show that the system detects unauthorized modifications in real time, labels each pod's trust state, and generates detailed audit logs. This work provides hardware-based continuous attestation for cloud native and edge deployments, strengthening the resilience of 5G as critical infrastructure in multi-vendor and mission-critical scenarios of 5G.△ Less

Title   : MobiLLM: An Agentic AI Framework for Closed-Loop Threat Mitigation in 6G Open RANs
Source  : Submitted 3 October, 2025; v1 submitted 25 September, 2025; originally announced September 2025.
Abstract: The evolution toward 6G networks is being accelerated by the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) paradigm -- an open, interoperablearchitecturethat enables intelligent, modular applications across public telecom and private enterprise domains. While this openness creates unprecedented opportunities for innovation, it also expands the attack surface, demanding resilient, low-cost, and autonomoussecuritysolutions. Legacy defenses remain largely reactive, labor-intensive, and inadequate for the scale and complexity of next-generation systems. Current O-RAN applications focus mainly on network optimization or passive threat detection, with limited capability for closed-loop, automated response.
  To address this critical gap, we present an agentic AI framework for fully automated, end-to-end threat mitigation in 6G O-RAN environments. MobiLLM orchestratessecurityworkflows through a modular multi-agent system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework features a Threat Analysis Agent for real-time data triage, a Threat Classification Agent that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to map anomalies to specific countermeasures, and a Threat Response Agent that safely operationalizes mitigation actions via O-RAN control interfaces. Grounded in trusted knowledge bases such as the MITRE FiGHT framework and 3GPP specifications, and equipped with robust safety guardrails, MobiLLM provides a blueprint for trustworthy AI-driven networksecurity. Initial evaluations demonstrate that MobiLLM can effectively identify and orchestrate complex mitigation strategies, significantly reducing response latency and showcasing the feasibility of autonomoussecurityoperations in 6G.△ Less

Title   : IntrusionX: A Hybrid Convolutional-LSTM Deep Learning Framework with Squirrel Search Optimization for Network Intrusion Detection
Source  : Submitted 3 October, 2025; v1 submitted 1 October, 2025; originally announced October 2025.
Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) face persistent challenges due to evolving cyberattacks, high-dimensional traffic data, and severe class imbalance in benchmark datasets such as NSL-KDD. To address these issues, we propose IntrusionX, a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for local feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal modeling. Thearchitectureis further optimized using the Squirrel Search Algorithm (SSA), enabling effective hyperparameter tuning while maintaining computational efficiency. Our pipeline incorporates rigorous preprocessing, stratified data splitting, and dynamic class weighting to enhance the detection of rare classes. Experimental evaluation on NSL-KDD demonstrates that IntrusionX achieves 98% accuracy in binary classification and 87% in 5-class classification, with significant improvements in minority class recall (U2R: 71%, R2L: 93%). The novelty of IntrusionX lies in its reproducible, imbalance-aware design with metaheuristic optimization.△ Less
